		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Quibb is an invite-only site which entrepreneurs and growth hackers like Andrew Chen, Hiten Shah, and Sean Ellis regularly post interesting articles and engage in great conversations. There's a ton of quality startup folks in here that really make Quibb community stand out from other social networks. Founder Sandi MacPherson only accepts 31% of the people who apply for membership, so you know you're interacting with people who know their stuff. I also love the email digests that are sent out that summarize all the activity that day from the people you follow. The only downside is that there is so many killer articles and links, I never know where to start.

Quibb rocks the kazbah...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Isn't it exciting when you discover a new corner of the Internet? Spending hours reading every blog post you can, often so bleary eyed at 2am, that you slam your laptop down, stumble into your bedroom, only to pull out your phone and read "one last post". My wife can't go to sleep unless I'm done looking at my phone, so she just grumbles passive aggressively till I shut that bad boy down.

What is this corner you might be asking?

The world of Internet Marketing.

You might be thinking, um Jack, that ish has been around since the nineties. Aren't they those spammy sites that my Dad accidentally signs up for? That's what I thought, till I started reading guys like <a href="http://smartpassiveincome.com">Pat Flynn</a>, <a href="http://mixergy.com/dane-maxwell-zannee-interview/">Dane Maxwell</a>, and <a href="http://internetbusinessmastery.com">Internet Business Mastery</a>. I continually wanted to punch them in the face, mainly because I wish I would have known this stuff earlier.

Here's a couple things that I've learned from pouring over their materials.
<h2>How to target keywords and generate better organic traffic through Google</h2>
Yea I know, SEO has been around since 1952, but hear me out. <a href="http://smartpassiveincome.com">Pat Flynn</a> did a <a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/nichesiteduel/">fantastic series of posts</a> where he and <a href="http://www.tyroneshum.com/">Tyrone Shum</a> challenged each other to create a niche site, get it to the #1 spot in Google, and monetize it. The most interesting part was how they pick keywords to target using a powerful tool called  <a title="Market Samurai" href="http://www.marketsamurai.com/">Market Samurai</a>. The amazing part of this tool is that it gives you a ridiculously detailed birds eye view of keywords and the competition around them.
<h2>Landing Page design</h2>
<a href="http://www.marketingshow.com/">Clay Collins</a> did a bunch of <a href="http://www.marketingshow.com/free-groupon-landing-page-squeeze-page-template/">fantastic posts</a> breaking down some of the most effective landing pages out there. He thoroughly analyzes <a href="http://groupon.com">Groupon</a> and <a href="http://appsumo.com">Appsumo</a>'s use of the double opt-in approach to increase conversions. I love Clay's energy and delivery.
<h2>Finding a market first, then extract the idea</h2>
In an <a href="http://internetbusinessmastery.com/ibm-168-internet-business-passive-income-with-software">interview with Internet Business Mastery</a>, entrepreneur <a href="http://thefoundation.io/sam-ovens-case/">Dane Maxwell</a> of <a href="http://thefoundation.io">Thefoundation.io</a> said that all of his ideas have come from a process he calls "idea extraction". He will ask someone in a potential market questions like "what's the most important thing you do at your job" and "what's the most frustrating part of your job?". All of these questions lead up to what Dane calls "finding the pain". I love Dane's approach because aligns perfectly with what I've read about Steve Blanks Customer Development process, which is also described in <a href="http://theleanstartup.com">The Lean Startup</a>, by <a href="www.startuplessonslearned.com">Eric Ries</a>. The recent fervor around the Lean Startup movement was built around "getting out of the building" and talking to customers, yet Dane has been doing that the whole time and getting amazing results.
<h2>How to outsource mundane tasks</h2>
After blazing through Tim Ferris's <a href="fourhourworkweek.com">Four Hour Workweek</a> (I know, I'm late to the game), I decided to take his advice on outsourcing mundane tasks and focus on tasks where I can bring the most value. I had an idea for a startup-kit daily email which would be generated from a list of links I had in a Google spreadsheet. I went to <a href="http://odesk.com">Odesk.com</a>, looked up a developer with a high rating, sent him the details, and by the next morning I had a fully functional Python script that worked perfectly. It only cost me $100.

Bam.
<h2>Cashflow and Boostrapping</h2>
If you read TechCrunch, you learn pretty quickly that startup culture <a href="http://birch.co/post/31057574153/congratulating-entrepreneurs-on-raising-money">celebrates raising millions of dollars</a> from big name investors. In the internet marketing world, it's all about one thing: CASHFLOW. What a novel idea; create a business that actually generates revenue AND profit. That's not sexy nor does it get you into cool parties, but it does create much more freedom. These guys are creating serious revenue and from what I gather have never raised a dime from investors. When I discovered that Pat Flynn <a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/my-income-reports/">posts his monthly income breakdown</a> on his blog, and my jaw dropped.

I'm not sure why, but the startup world and the internet marketing world seem to have very little crossover. Maybe it's just me, but I think both sides would benefit from each other in big ways.]]></content:encoded>

YES! ITS SHOCKING. I'd love to help bring the two together somehow.. it all clicked for me after years of following Ramit Sethi, and realizing that his business was information, and distribution was email. It was just incredible. 

Jaws drop when I tell founders "You don't need good design, you need good copy. A lot of good copy."]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes it hurts to hear why people delete their accounts on your site; but if you look closer, there is a lot to learn. On a whim, I decided to put a simple Google Docs form on our account deletion page.

<a href="http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/delete_account.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-605" title="Delete Account" alt="Delete Account" src="http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/delete_account.png" width="707" height="714" /></a>

I wasn't sure what to expect after I pushed it live, but after a couple months we've received a ton of useful feedback. I never thought people would take the time to write something useful AND leave their email address to make sure we could follow up, but they did. Here are some of the most common feedback:
<ul>
	<li>I love the service, but it's missing a few key features</li>
	<li>I love the service, and am just deleting my account to open it under another email address</li>
	<li>I love the service, but am closing down my business</li>
	<li>You guys suck and I want to punch all of you in the face</li>
</ul>
We learned pretty quickly that focusing solely the the number of people deleting their accounts doesn't always tell the whole story.

Here is a screenshot of the spreadsheet that is populated by the Google form:

		<title>Creating an accountability system using IFTTT</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My friend <a href="http://charlie-brenneman.com">Charlie</a> is a professional MMA fighter who has fought in <a href="http://www.ufc.com/fighter/Charlie-Brenneman">UFC fights</a> with hundreds of thousands of viewers worldwide. Whenever I think my job is tough, I think of Charlie getting paid to get punched in the face.

One thing we both have in common is hustle. We both want to excel in every aspect of our lives and are obsessed with living to our full potential. But like all border-line OCD success fanatics, we struggle with the day to day distractions of TV, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest (cough, did I say Pinterest? woops...)

I recently read an article about a guy who <a href="http://hackthesystem.com/blog/why-i-hired-a-girl-on-craigslist-to-slap-me-in-the-face-and-why-it-quadrupled-my-productivity/">hired someone to punch him in the face every time he checked Facebook</a>. I briefly considered hiring Charlie to do the same thing, but realized I'd be dead after 10 minutes of Facebook wall checking twitches.

We agreed that accountability is the key, so we set up a system to track our productivity.
<h2>Step 1 - Set up a Google Form</h2>
I went over to <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzgaUOW6GIs">created a form</a> with several questions.
<ul>
	<li>What time did I wake up?</li>
	<li>Did I check Facebook more than once today?</li>
	<li>How much TV did I watch today?</li>
	<li>Did I listen to at least 2 podcasts or leadership cd's today?</li>
	<li>Did I spend more than 1 10 minute session reading useless blogs, news sites, etc...?</li>
	<li>How would I rate my day today? (1 - 5)</li>
	<li>Notes about my day</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-9.46.56-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-589" title="Hustle" alt="Hustle" src="http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-9.46.56-PM.png" width="400" /></a>
<h2>Use IFTTT to create automation</h2>
IFTTT is an amazing tool that allows you to create "recipes" that combine various web apps to do automated tasks. I create a recipe to send an email to Charlie and I from my Gmail account every night at 8pm. This email contains a link a to the form to fill out.

<a href="http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ifttt.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-594" title="ifttt" alt="ifttt" src="http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ifttt-300x233.png" width="300" height="233" /></a>
<h2>Check the results</h2>
After a couple days, check the results and see how both parties have faired. This is the key to the whole process; it's open and honest. Anytime you have a bad day, you realize that someone else will be seeing it, which makes you think twice anytime you want to skip off to check Twitter for the 4,000 time. (Results are blurred to protect the innocent)

<a href="http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/results2.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-598" title="Google spreadsheet results" alt="Google spreadsheet results" src="http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/results2-1024x482.png" width="640" height="301" /></a>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
This experiment has definitely improved my productivity, but I admit it's tough to keep up with. There are some days that you just don't feel like filling out the form because you knew you had a day filled with distractions. I feel like it could be even more effective if we invited a couple other people into the process, but we wanted to test it with two first.

It doesn't have to center around productivity either, this could work for dieting, fitness, smoking, etc...

So what are you waiting for?

I took pages and pages of notes, and drove my wife Marisa <strong>crazy</strong> talking about it non-stop.

Not just modern marketing, but WAY back to the 50’s, 60’s, 70’s, 80’s. (I threw in some newer stuff at the end).

The <strong>REAL</strong> stuff. Where it all started.

You may be thinking JACK, I’m a designer, I’m a CEO, I’m a VP of Flippity Flop at Flippity dot com, why should I care about marketing?

<strong>Everyone is a marketer.</strong>

In fact, last night, my wife Marisa used a legendary marketing technique called “Price Anchoring” (Steve Jobs was a master at this)
<ul>
	<li>Marisa: <em>“JACKIE I just got this Jacket ON SALE for $255 that was originally over $365!”</em></li>
	<li>Me: <em>“So you spent $255?...”</em></li>
	<li>Marisa:<em> “But I COULD have spent $365, we got a DEAL and SAVED $110. DUH!”</em></li>
	<li>Me: <em>“sigh...”</em></li>
</ul>
So hear me out and I <strong>promise</strong> you’ll find something below that will help you build your business.
<h2>Gary Halbert - Copywriting Legend</h2>
All of the copywriters I found pointed to Gary as the best copywriter of all time. The guy is a legend. (He passed away a few years ago sadly)

Here’s what you can learn from Gary:
<ul>
	<li>I read 26 letters (called the Boron Letters) Gary wrote to his son teaching him all his secrets of marketing and copywriting.</li>
	<li>The <strong>CRAZY</strong> part was he wrote these while he was in <strong>JAIL</strong>.</li>
	<li>One minute he’s breaking down the psychology of a sale, and the next he’s dropping his pen to avoid a prison fight. Intense.</li>
	<li>He was preaching Lean Startup techniques <strong>WAY</strong> before it was cool. Check out these excerpts:
<ul>
	<li>“You Don't Have To Get It Right...You Just Have To Get It MOVING”</li>
	<li>“But, what's important, really important, is to find out if your idea has any merit as fast as possible!”</li>
	<li>“I want to burn this message into your mind. Be skeptical of what people say. Be skeptical of surveys. Of questionnaires. Instead, believe in numbers.”</li>
	<li>“You Must Always Find A Market First...And Then Concentrate On A Product!”</li>
	<li>“The mistake is finding or developing a product FIRST and then looking for a market to sell it to. This is backasswards.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Eugene Schwartz - Author of Breakthrough Advertising</h2>
Last week I listened to 2 hours of very old recorded speeches from this guy and was blown away. His book "Breakthrough Advertising" goes for $175 on Amazon because it's out of print and very rare.

Here’s what you can learn from Eugene:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Be the best listener you know</strong>
<ul>
	<li>If you're not spending 2 hours a day connecting with your market, you will have 3 good years and then you're finished</li>
	<li>At dinner parties, sit down and LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN</li>
	<li>The most powerful word in marketing is "YOU"</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Work extremely intensely in spurts</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Set a timer for 33.33 minutes and work ONLY the job at hand. NOTHING ELSE! Take a 5 min break then repeat. (I loved this one)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Writers Block - The conscious mind is VERY narrow</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Mozart never ever rewrote</li>
	<li>How did he do it?</li>
	<li>He composed at a billiard table with a pen. He held the cue ball and threw it randomly. He had to focus on trajectory. While the conscious mind was focused on ball, his unconscious was focused on creativity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Write to the chimpanzee brain. Simply. Directly.</strong>
<ul>
	<li>You use the chimpanzee brain when reading copy</li>
	<li>Use very simple, dramatic and very vivid words</li>
	<li>Inside of us we have this hidden chimpanzee</li>
	<li>You want the person to look through the copy and see the product inside</li>
	<li>Don't let the layout stand out over the copy</li>
	<li>No words with more than 3 syllables</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Channel demand, never sell</strong>
<ul>
	<li>You are not creating demand, you can only channel demand</li>
	<li>If you think you are creating demand for a product you've doomed yourself to failure</li>
	<li>The demand has to exist before you walk into the picture</li>
	<li>You take the demand and channel it into your product</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><strong>Think about what your product DOES, not IS</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Make gratification INSTANTANEOUS</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Failing often, and testing big differences shows you are trying hard enough</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Dane Maxwell - Software Rebel</h2>
Dane is a lot younger (30's) than these old guys, but is REALLY smart when it comes to marketing and building software.

He's never been featured onTechcrunch or Mashable, but the dude has created a 500k/year software business without one dime of VC money.

Here’s a couple things you can learn from Dane:
<ul>
	<li>Be <strong>CLEAR</strong> not <strong>CLEVER</strong> when writing copy for your site</li>
	<li>It’s not about your <strong>PRODUCT</strong>, it’s about your <strong>CUSTOMER</strong></li>
	<li>If you can describe the customers problem better than they can, then they will assume you have the solution</li>
	<li>Think of your solution first in terms of the <strong>benefits</strong>. Not the <strong>features</strong>. Every feature is there to get the client a benefit not to get them a feature.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Neville Medhora - Kopywriting King</h2>
Neville is the genius behind AppSumo's email marketing. (AppSumo is like a Groupon for entrepreneurs, it's amazing).

If you've ever received an email from them you know how fantastic they are.

Hilarious, informative, and <strong>MAN</strong> do they get you to buy every time. It's tough to resist.

This next fact blew me away...

Their emails have a <strong>MINIMUM</strong> of 100% open rate, meaning people open these emails again <strong>3 or 4 times</strong>!

Neville has studied all the greats and know what he's doing.

Here's a few things I picked up in his materials:
<ul>
	<li>When writing remember this: <strong>NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU</strong> (They care about themselves)</li>
	<li>Always speak about the benefit for the customer</li>
	<li>Use the <strong>AIDA</strong> formula to write emails
<ul>
	<li><strong>Attention</strong> (Grab their attention instantly)</li>
	<li><strong>Interest</strong> (Provide them interested with relevant facts)</li>
	<li><strong>Desire</strong> (Help them see the benefit)</li>
	<li><strong>Action</strong> (Instruct them on what to do next)</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>"The point of the first line is to make them read the second like, and the point of the second line to make them read the third line" - David Ogilvy</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you already built an awesome business/startup and you're too cool for school, don't read anything below this line.

Tell me if this relates to you...

You're in the shower singing Back At One by Brian McKnight (woops maybe just me) and you get a KILLER idea.

Like, for real guys, a KILLER idea...

You sprint to your computer and Google the domain "unbreakableshowcurtainrings.com"

CRAP, somebody bought it!

Oh well you'll just buy unbreakableshowcurtainRINGZ.biz

BOOM YOU'RE IN BUSINESS!

You call up your bff who's a pretty smart Sys-Admin down at AwesomeTech.

"DUDE I've got the best idea EVER. I should probably have you sign an NDA before I tell you this because someone is gonna steal it like in the Facebook movie...Don't steal it bro."

AND GUESS WHAT...HE SAYS IT'S AN AWESOME IDEA!

Then you realize you have to actually BUILD the unbreakable shower curtain rings...

You ask yourself, do people need unbreakable shower curtain rings?

"OF COURSE THEY DO, BECAUSE IT'S MY IDEA AND THEY WILL BUY IT BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT!"

You think to yourself "I've gotta act on this NOW or someone else is gonna build these bad boys".

You head over to Amazon and buy a book on Shower Curtain Ring Building For Dummies for $85, a new laptop for $3000 (if you're gonna do this for real you need the RIGHT equipment), and a sweet new desk for all the hours you're going to put into the biz.

Then you command tab over to Google again and look for shower curtain ring manufacturers.

After scrolling mindlessly through pages of confusing links, you soon think to yourself, eh this is kinda hard.

I'll pick it up again tomorrow night.

Oh well, back to the shower.

I've probably repeated this process about 100 times in my life.

So has my Dad. (It runs in the family I guess)

(My favorite invention of my Dads is called the SlinkyDrink. I'll leave it at that.)

If you're like me, you're probably looking for a better way to go about this.

If you aren't looking for a better way, then let me ask Dr. Phil...

"How's that workin for ya?"

Dane Maxwell had a great way of putting it.

What is the ONLY thing you need to have a business?

Not a business card
Not a logo
Not a "brand"
Not a website
You only need one thing.

What is it?

A paying customer.

I hate you Jack.

If you go out and build a product, design a logo and print up sweet embossed business cards you STILL don't have a business.

All you have is a website, logo and cards.

The goal is to VALIDATE the business in the quickest most efficient way possible BEFORE doing all of the above.

Startup guru Steve Blank describes a start up as "an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model".
So in the beginning, you're in the search phase, not the "build it and they will come" phase.

That only worked for Kevin Costner...

Let me explain a real life example of testing an idea:

At my parents house in PA there's a mirror in the back hallway that some would call a "skinny mirror"

It literally takes off 10 pounds and makes you look freakin fantastic...

I asked my Mom "Don't you think other people would want this mirror too?"

"JACKIE THAT'S IT! THAT'S A MILLION DOLLAR IDEA! GO MAKE THEM. GO MAKE 1000 RIGHT NOW!"

Instead of going down the usual path of crazytown, I stopped myself.

I wanted to test it first.

I bought the domain http://myskinnymirror.com for $5.99 and threw up a SUPER simple html page with a free MailChimp email signup embed.

My Mom kept saying "Wait you can't put a website up yet, you don't have the mirrors!"

I kept telling her that I would ONLY buy the mirrors if I got a ton of signups.

If I didn't then I wouldn't buy any mirrors.

You'll never believe what happened next.

Even after Pinning it, Facebooking it AND Twittering it, I got a grand total of THREE signups, which included my sister Kayla and my wife Marisa.

I was PUMPED!

Why would you be pumped??? Nobody signed up???

I was pumped because I just saved myself a BOATLOAD of time AND money.

OK great Jack, how do I go about testing these ideas?

Check out all the links below, then email your idea and we can figure out how to test it.

Every idea is different so I can't just point to ONE way to do it.

If you're looking for an <strong>AMAZING</strong> amount of information on every single step in the development of a startup, this book is for you. There's no way you can read it like a normal book because of the sheer amount of information inside. It's best to use it as a reference manual. Highly highly recommended if you're serious about building a business.

<h2>Jay Abraham - School of Copywriting</h2>
This video has a ton of useful tips in it.

His idea about going to review sites (book reviews, app reviews, any type of reviews) to find the language that customers use to describe the problem is GENIUS.

You can get tons of actionable information by researching competitors app reviews for what customers love/hate about it.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTbmqyvurs">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTbmqyvurs</a>

I followed his advice, and when my friend Justin and I wanted to build an app for Crossfitters, I went to the Google Play store and wrote down all the useful reviews left by satisfied and unsatisfied customers from competitors apps. It's a <strong>GOLDMINE</strong> of information.

"The answer is usually along the lines of, “it’s a really great idea and we use the product so much, we know our customers will.” But how do you know the idea will succeed, have you tested it with your customers? Ah, but Steve Jobs didn’t do market tests when he created the iPhone, he just made it."

<h2>The Gary Halbert Letter - TEST TEST TEST</h2>
"Hear this: Most new marketing ideas fail. That's OK. You just keep swinging the bat till you hit a home run and then, once you've got your winner, you simply milk it for all it's worth. But, what's important, really important, is to find out if your idea has any merit as fast as possible! And, the way to do that is by..."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had lunch last week with entrepreneur and all around great guy <strong>Bobby Goshal</strong>, founder of <a href="http://flud.it" target="_blank">Flud</a>.

I asked him a question to see if I was crazy.

"I am crazy? Most days, I'll be listening to a TedTalk podcast on my laptop while I'm working, then <strong>sprint</strong> to the bathroom and start reading a business book on my phone (my wife yells me for staying in there so long), then sprint <strong>back</strong> to laptop, listen to a Stanford Leadership Podcast, then <strong>jump</strong> in the car to pick up my son from school and <strong>immediately</strong> put on a Startup School talk from Seth Godin." (I turn it off when he gets in so DON'T YOU JUDGE ME, haha...)

"Then there are times when I'll walk around Target with my phone up to my ear listening to a Dave Ramsey seminar while Marisa shops (which could take hours). Later on that evening I'll fall asleep with a headphone in my ear listening to a Mixergy interview...(until I finally hear the obvious <em>put that phone away</em> sigh from Marisa)"

I knew I wasn't alone when Bobby jumped up, yelled <em><strong>HECK YEA</strong></em> and high-fived me...

This is the whole reason I write this newsletter.

I <strong>KNOW</strong> there's got to be other <strong>crazies</strong> out there that want to make a real impact on the world and <strong>LOVE</strong> learning as much as they possibly can... <em>whenever</em> and <em>wherever</em> they can.

The most exciting thing about the web to me is the sheer amount of amazing <strong>FREE</strong> information out there for the taking.

Podcasts are the perfect learning method, because you can listen <strong>AND</strong> do other things at the same time.

Listen while you're at <strong>work</strong>.

If you can't listen while you <strong>work</strong>, then <strong>driving</strong> is the perfect time.

If you don't <strong>drive</strong>, then listen on the <strong>walk</strong> to work.

If you don't <strong>walk</strong> to work then listen on the <strong>train</strong>, <strong>bus</strong> or <strong>subway</strong>.

If you don't do any of those, <strong>you've got other problems...</strong>

If you get in the habit of listening <strong><em>every day</em></strong>, it will change your life and your business.

I <strong>guaran-freakin-tee-it</strong> brah.

<strong>Here are a list of my favorites</strong>
<h2>Seth Godin Startup School</h2>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Motivation is like a shower, you can't just do it once and be done with it.

It's a daily process.

<strong>JACK DON'T YOU DARE SEND ME A TONY ROBBINS VIDEO.</strong>

But honestly, what things do you watch, listen to or read to keep that fire alive?

Sometimes, as we go about building our businesses, chasing our passions, and making the best possible art we can, <strong>we lose that fire</strong>.

We may even go days, weeks, months or even years putting on a fake smile and pretending we still love what we are doing.

I started feeling bad for myself, until I read this article about Mother Theresa in Time Magazine.

Listen to this excerpt and then tell me you don't feel like a <strong>huge jerk</strong> for being sad because your mobile-local-photo-sharing-app idea isn't panning out...

<em>She began tending the poor and dying in Calcutta, and — except for a five-week break in 1959 — never abated. Although perpetually cheery in public, the Teresa of the letters lived in a state of deep and abiding spiritual pain. In more than 40 communications, many of which have never before been published, she bemoans the "dryness," "darkness," "loneliness" and "torture" she is undergoing. She compares the experience to hell and at one point says it has driven her to doubt the existence of heaven and even of God. She is acutely aware of the discrepancy between her inner state and her public demeanor. "The smile," she writes, is "a mask" or "a cloak that covers everything." Similarly, she wonders whether she is engaged in verbal deception. "I spoke as if my very heart was in love with God — tender, personal love," she remarks to an adviser. "If you were [there], you would have said, 'What hypocrisy.'"</em>

Regardless of what background you come from, you've got to feel her pain.

She was willing to go through and suffer immense personal pain to help and provide value to others.

If you don't have a reason behind what you're doing, you're playing it safe.

If you're not jumping out of bed every morning PUMPED to start the day, you're playing it safe.
<h2><strong>Look at the tragic death of Aaron Swartz.</strong></h2>
<em>"A computer prodigy, Swartz co-authored an early version of the popular Internet tool RSS at age 14 and would later become an early leader of Reddit, the social website that has become a locus of Internet activism." - Time</em>

Look through some of these memorial posts and tell me he didn't make a difference in the world.

<h2><strong>Or take the story of Eric Thomas...</strong></h2>
a high school dropout from the streets of Detroit who lived in abandoned buildings (often eating out of garbage cans to survive) and his insatiable mission to help disadvantaged youth in America.

Now he's speaking to high schools across the nation, the NFL, the NBA, and ESPN; all while getting his PHD from the University of Michigan.

Here's the video that made his career:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDFC16ptx-0" target="_blank">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDFC16ptx-0</a>

I listen to his mixtape a lot while working out, it's ridiculous.

		<title>A story about Sarah...</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is a story about a woman named Sarah White and how she changed my life.

Sometimes people are in and out of your life for a season, and Sarah just happened to enter my life at one of the most important crossroads in my life, after I graduated college.

Like most college graduates I was <strong>REALLY</strong> smart and thought it would be cool to copy/paste/send my resume to every company I saw on Monster.com (which was the <strong>BOMB</strong> back in '03)...

Sweet strategy with a real personal touch right? I was <strong>SO</strong> sure I was gonna be rakin in a cool 100k my first year that I went out with my parents to look at new 2003 Eagle Talons (they were also the <strong>BOMB</strong> in '03).

Senior year was awesome because I managed to get my semester credit load down to like 8 credits, so I slept a LOT (I have 2 kids now, so sleep is no longer on the menu) and played a lot of Madden.

I remember the day I got the first call from Sarah.

<em>(Read the following in a really sophisticated soft English accent)</em>

<em>"Hello Jack, this is Sarah White from Pentagram"</em>

All the blood rushed to my face...

<em>"Cough cough, awkward swallow, Hi Sarah"</em>

<em>"We got your resume and cover letter and we'd like to meet with you"</em>

I held the edge of my busted Ikea desk to prevent from passing out.

<em>"Ok great, I'll be right over, bye"</em>

That's not at all what I said, but that's what it felt like.

<strong>I was on my way to NYC.</strong>

The next week, I took a flight to JFK, got lost and figured<em> "Hey why not just get off the subway in East New York and ask some nice fella where I can find the Holiday Inn in Times Square?"</em>

I was definitely walking around the worst part of New York in a 5th grade chorus concert suit and tie. Off to a great start.

I finally made it to my destination, the offices of Pentagram New York.

When I walked into the lobby the first person I met was Sarah.

She had bright white skin, piercing green eyes, and a smile that was instantly comforting.

When she led me up to meet my future boss Lisa Strausfeld and Senior Designer Jiae Kim, I remember seeing a <strong>GIANT</strong> jug of water with wonderfully juicy lemons in it.

My Mom taught me to always look people in the eye and shake their hand, but on that day I wanted to dive across the table and freakin down that whole jug.

I kept my cool, sat down, and NAILED the interview.

That above statement was true, except for the fact that was definitely not.

Who knows what I said, but two weeks later Lisa offered me the job.

<strong>So began the rest of my design career in New York.</strong>

I found out later the Sarah was the one who pulled my resume out of the stack of resumes, and handed it to Lisa, who opened up my website at the exact moment that Paula Scher walked by and said <em>"hire him"</em> to Lisa.

In that moment that Sarah decided to pull out some random students resume with big red letters that said "JACK ZERBY", she changed the entire direction of my life.

Over the nest 2 years, there was never a day that Sarah didn't encourage me.

We both had a passion for music (huge Al Green fans), and me being a singer-songwriter, she constantly pushed me to write better lyrics and push the boundaries of my musical comfort zone.

<em>"Jackie...you and I both know those lyrics were rushed, you just wanted to get the song done. COMON JACKIE!"</em>

I would get really mad, but I knew she was right. ARRRGG :)

She came to many of my gigs where it was just me, the bartender, Sarah, Lisa, Jiae and Leslie. (I totally owe all of them big time for the crappy beers they had to order to avoid paying a cover.)

When Marisa would come visit, she had printed out tons fun things for Marisa and I to do in the city. We were from Pennsylvania, so our idea of fun was Olive Garden in Times Square.

The most important thing she ever said to me I remember like it was yesterday.

We were sitting in a coffee shop with Jiae, and were going around the table asking Sarah what she though our biggest flaw was. (still have <em>no</em> idea why we asked her that)

She turned to me and said <em>"Jack, the biggest flaw I see in you is that you won't take risks, you're afraid of risk and you're afraid of change".</em>

At the moment I brushed it off, but that stuck with me for a long time, because she was dead on. I was scared to take risks. Man, English people don't pull any punches.

A couple months went by, and I hadn't heard from Sarah in a bit.

Then I got a call from Lisa.

<em>"Jack, Sarah is sick, and well, she has cancer, and... is in the hospital"</em>

I remember the moment I walked in to see her for the first time, that she wasn't going to make it.

That sounds harsh, but that's how she was. She cared so deeply for others, but was always down on herself. I don't think she had the emotional strength to fight.

I always brought my guitar when I visited her (she probably wouldn't let me in if I didn't). I would sit and play her new songs and old songs, and even in her current circumstances STILL didn't let any lame lyric get by her.

It's really tough to write these last few sentences.

I remember the last time I was with her.

Lisa called me earlier that day and said I should probably come over as soon as I can because it probably won't be much longer.

It was just Sarah, me and my guitar. She was hanging on by a thread at that point and was barely conscious, but I played her songs for over an hour.

The slow painful heaving through her oxygen machine played softly behind my cover of "Sittin on the Dock of the Bay".

Soon I knew it was time to go, so I put the pick in the neck of my guitar, kissed her head, and said <em>"Thank you".</em>

I know Sarah was smiling down at me the day I quit my job to build a company with my partners Jonathan and David, and I know she'll do the same every time I take a risk and move out of my comfort zone.

Thank you Sarah White. Thank you.
