<!-- more -->

Sometimes people are in and out of your life for a season, and Sarah just happened to enter my life at one of the most important crossroads in my life, after I graduated college.

Like most college graduates I was **REALLY** smart and thought it would be cool to copy/paste/send my resume to every company I saw on Monster.com (which was the **BOMB** back in '03)...

Sweet strategy with a real personal touch right? I was **SO** sure I was gonna be rakin in a cool 100k my first year that I went out with my parents to look at new 2003 Eagle Talons (they were also the **BOMB** in '03).

Senior year was awesome because I managed to get my semester credit load down to like 8 credits, so I slept a LOT (I have 2 kids now, so sleep is no longer on the menu) and played a lot of Madden.

I remember the day I got the first call from Sarah.

_(Read the following in a really sophisticated soft English accent)_

_"Hello Jack, this is Sarah White from Pentagram"_

All the blood rushed to my face...

_"Cough cough, awkward swallow, Hi Sarah"_

_"We got your resume and cover letter and we'd like to meet with you"_

I held the edge of my busted Ikea desk to prevent from passing out.

_"Ok great, I'll be right over, bye"_

That's not at all what I said, but that's what it felt like.

**I was on my way to NYC.**

The next week, I took a flight to JFK, got lost and figured_ "Hey why not just get off the subway in East New York and ask some nice fella where I can find the Holiday Inn in Times Square?"_

I was definitely walking around the worst part of New York in a 5th grade chorus concert suit and tie. Off to a great start.

I finally made it to my destination, the offices of Pentagram New York.

When I walked into the lobby the first person I met was Sarah.

She had bright white skin, piercing green eyes, and a smile that was instantly comforting.

When she led me up to meet my future boss Lisa Strausfeld and Senior Designer Jiae Kim, I remember seeing a **GIANT** jug of water with wonderfully juicy lemons in it.

My Mom taught me to always look people in the eye and shake their hand, but on that day I wanted to dive across the table and freakin down that whole jug.

I kept my cool, sat down, and NAILED the interview.

That above statement was true, except for the fact that was definitely not.

Who knows what I said, but two weeks later Lisa offered me the job.

**So began the rest of my design career in New York.**

I found out later the Sarah was the one who pulled my resume out of the stack of resumes, and handed it to Lisa, who opened up my website at the exact moment that Paula Scher walked by and said _"hire him"_ to Lisa.

In that moment that Sarah decided to pull out some random students resume with big red letters that said "JACK ZERBY", she changed the entire direction of my life.

Over the nest 2 years, there was never a day that Sarah didn't encourage me.

We both had a passion for music (huge Al Green fans), and me being a singer-songwriter, she constantly pushed me to write better lyrics and push the boundaries of my musical comfort zone.

_"Jackie...you and I both know those lyrics were rushed, you just wanted to get the song done. COMON JACKIE!"_

I would get really mad, but I knew she was right. ARRRGG :)

She came to many of my gigs where it was just me, the bartender, Sarah, Lisa, Jiae and Leslie. (I totally owe all of them big time for the crappy beers they had to order to avoid paying a cover.)

When Marisa would come visit, she had printed out tons fun things for Marisa and I to do in the city. We were from Pennsylvania, so our idea of fun was Olive Garden in Times Square.

The most important thing she ever said to me I remember like it was yesterday.

We were sitting in a coffee shop with Jiae, and were going around the table asking Sarah what she though our biggest flaw was. (still have _no_ idea why we asked her that)

She turned to me and said _"Jack, the biggest flaw I see in you is that you won't take risks, you're afraid of risk and you're afraid of change"._

At the moment I brushed it off, but that stuck with me for a long time, because she was dead on. I was scared to take risks. Man, English people don't pull any punches.

A couple months went by, and I hadn't heard from Sarah in a bit.

Then I got a call from Lisa.

_"Jack, Sarah is sick, and well, she has cancer, and... is in the hospital"_

I remember the moment I walked in to see her for the first time, that she wasn't going to make it.

That sounds harsh, but that's how she was. She cared so deeply for others, but was always down on herself. I don't think she had the emotional strength to fight.

I always brought my guitar when I visited her (she probably wouldn't let me in if I didn't). I would sit and play her new songs and old songs, and even in her current circumstances STILL didn't let any lame lyric get by her.

It's really tough to write these last few sentences.

I remember the last time I was with her.

Lisa called me earlier that day and said I should probably come over as soon as I can because it probably won't be much longer.

It was just Sarah, me and my guitar. She was hanging on by a thread at that point and was barely conscious, but I played her songs for over an hour.

The slow painful heaving through her oxygen machine played softly behind my cover of "Sittin on the Dock of the Bay".

Soon I knew it was time to go, so I put the pick in the neck of my guitar, kissed her head, and said _"Thank you"._

I know Sarah was smiling down at me the day I quit my job to build a company with my partners Jonathan and David, and I know she'll do the same every time I take a risk and move out of my comfort zone.

Thank you Sarah White. Thank you.
