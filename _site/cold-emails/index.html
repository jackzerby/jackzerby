        <div class="blog-post-body"><p>"Hey Zack Gerby, I saw your site Goodzies.net, did no research and thought you would be interested in giving me money for my services."</p>

<p>If I get one more ridiculous cold email like this I'm going to, well...son of a...do absolutely nothing because I can't stop it anyway...sigh.</p>

<p>What I CAN do is suggest some ideas that will make your cold emails more effective.</p>

<p><strong>I'll start by showing you some of the worst emails I've received, along with some commentary on why they are so bad. Names are redacted to protect the guity :)</strong></p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<p>Subject line: <em>Jack, let me share my positive mood with you=)</em></p>

<p>Message:
Dear Jack, hope your day started off on the right note=) I understand that you are a busy person and I don't want to waste your time. I am doing my best and trying to be helpful. I represent global software development company headquartered in San Francisco, California with development centers in Ukraine. Jack, I would be delighted to know that you may see some opportunity for cooperation and hope I'm not over stepping my boundaries but I'll be happy set up a short phone call for you with our VP from the USA in the next few weeks if you have a few minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> They're not selling a positive mood, they're selling a service. The first few sentences contain the words <em>"waste"</em>, <em>"doing my best"</em>, and <em>"trying"</em>. None of these words inspire any kind of confidence and should be avoided UNLESS they pertain to the value of your service. If they had said <em>"I'm sure you'll agree that there's a ton of time wasted in application development, here's how we can save you half that time."</em> The phrase <em>"hope I'm not over stepping my boundaries"</em> is basically apologizing for sending a cold email. Don't apologize, be excited about the fact that you have something that's going to dramatically improve their business. Guess what the follow up email's subject line was? <em>"Trying kindly to break the code of your silence=)"</em>. Awwwkward.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<p>Subject Line: <em>Request for a Meeting</em></p>

<p>Message: Dear Jack, I trust this mail finds you well. My name is John Doe and I am with Company X, a global IT Services company. The purpose of my contact is to explore possible opportunities in the areas of Software Development &amp; QA/ Testing Services. My colleague, Mr. Joe Smith (VP, Sales - East Coast) is visiting Florida on the 26th, 27th of August. We are hoping to schedule a meeting with you at your offices to introduce our company; elaborate on our services and lay down possible next steps in the interaction. I would appreciate if you could suggest a convenient date and time that suits your schedule for our meeting.</p>

<p>ValueLabs’ Expertise &amp; Service Offerings:
Quality Assurance and Testing
MOSS 2007 &amp; SharePoint 2010
(A ton more random services)</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> This email is an example of a spray and pray approach. They obviously don't know what software we use and instead of asking, they list out 20 different software services hoping one of them applies to our business. Do you really think a 5 or 6 person web startup (you can find out how many employees we have on our website) is using Microsoft Sharepoint 2010 or MOSS 2007? Also, they describe the purpose of the meeting as <em>"introduce our company; elaborate on our services"</em>. It seems that this meeting is all about THEM, not about solving my problems.</p>

<hr />

<p>I could keep pasting these gems, but I think you get the point. Cold emails CAN be effective if you do your research and address specific things you can help with.</p>

<p>In the past 3 weeks I've been researching pain-points in the Crossfit gym owner space. I'm not selling anything, just asking a simple question: "<em>In a sentence or two, what is the biggest problem you face on a day-to-day basis running your gym?"</em>. I found the emails by going on crossfit.com and clicking on the various links to gyms. The emails were publicly available so I wasn't doing anything black hat.</p>

<p><strong>First batch</strong></p>

<p>Subject line: <em>Strange question...</em></p>

<p><em>Response Rate: 0%</em></p>

<p>I started with a basic message with no first name. Not very personal and easily detected as a mass email.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Second batch</strong></p>

<p>Subject line: <em>Strange question...</em></p>

<p><em>Response Rate: 15%</em></p>

<p>This time I researched and found the gym owners first name, with the same message. Just by adding the first name, my response rate jumped significantly. Also, I added a PS at the end that offered to send them the results of the research when complete, making sure they get some valuable information in return for participation.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Third batch</strong></p>

<p>Subject line:<em>Strange question...</em></p>

<p><em>Response Rate: 40%</em></p>

<p>I was getting some great responses and some very specific pain points, so I decided to include some of them in the next batch of emails. This time the gym owners were referred to by their first name AND I described problems that were instantly related because they were the exact words of their peers.</p>
