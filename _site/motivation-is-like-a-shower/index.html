But honestly, what things do you watch, listen to or read to keep that fire alive?

Sometimes, as we go about building our businesses, chasing our passions, and making the best possible art we can, **we lose that fire**.

We may even go days, weeks, months or even years putting on a fake smile and pretending we still love what we are doing.

I started feeling bad for myself, until I read this article about Mother Theresa in Time Magazine.

Listen to this excerpt and then tell me you don't feel like a **huge jerk** for being sad because your mobile-local-photo-sharing-app idea isn't panning out...

_She began tending the poor and dying in Calcutta, and — except for a five-week break in 1959 — never abated. Although perpetually cheery in public, the Teresa of the letters lived in a state of deep and abiding spiritual pain. In more than 40 communications, many of which have never before been published, she bemoans the "dryness," "darkness," "loneliness" and "torture" she is undergoing. She compares the experience to hell and at one point says it has driven her to doubt the existence of heaven and even of God. She is acutely aware of the discrepancy between her inner state and her public demeanor. "The smile," she writes, is "a mask" or "a cloak that covers everything." Similarly, she wonders whether she is engaged in verbal deception. "I spoke as if my very heart was in love with God — tender, personal love," she remarks to an adviser. "If you were [there], you would have said, 'What hypocrisy.'"_

Regardless of what background you come from, you've got to feel her pain.

She was willing to go through and suffer immense personal pain to help and provide value to others.

If you don't have a reason behind what you're doing, you're playing it safe.

If you're not jumping out of bed every morning PUMPED to start the day, you're playing it safe.

## **Or take the story of Eric Thomas...**

a high school dropout from the streets of Detroit who lived in abandoned buildings (often eating out of garbage cans to survive) and his insatiable mission to help disadvantaged youth in America.

Now he's speaking to high schools across the nation, the NFL, the NBA, and ESPN; all while getting his PHD from the University of Michigan.

Here's the video that made his career:
