I took pages and pages of notes, and drove my wife Marisa **crazy** talking about it non-stop.

You may be thinking JACK, I’m a designer, I’m a CEO, I’m a VP of Flippity Flop at Flippity dot com, why should I care about marketing?

In fact, last night, my wife Marisa used a legendary marketing technique called “Price Anchoring” (Steve Jobs was a master at this)

## Gary Halbert - Copywriting Legend

All of the copywriters I found pointed to Gary as the best copywriter of all time. The guy is a legend. (He passed away a few years ago sadly)

Here’s what you can learn from Gary:

*   I read 26 letters (called the Boron Letters) Gary wrote to his son teaching him all his secrets of marketing and copywriting.
*   The **CRAZY** part was he wrote these while he was in **JAIL**.
*   One minute he’s breaking down the psychology of a sale, and the next he’s dropping his pen to avoid a prison fight. Intense.
*   He was preaching Lean Startup techniques **WAY** before it was cool. Check out these excerpts:

    *   “You Don't Have To Get It Right...You Just Have To Get It MOVING”
    *   “But, what's important, really important, is to find out if your idea has any merit as fast as possible!”
    *   “I want to burn this message into your mind. Be skeptical of what people say. Be skeptical of surveys. Of questionnaires. Instead, believe in numbers.”
    *   “You Must Always Find A Market First...And Then Concentrate On A Product!”
    *   “The mistake is finding or developing a product FIRST and then looking for a market to sell it to. This is backasswards.”

## Eugene Schwartz - Author of Breakthrough Advertising

Last week I listened to 2 hours of very old recorded speeches from this guy and was blown away. His book "Breakthrough Advertising" goes for $175 on Amazon because it's out of print and very rare.

Here’s what you can learn from Eugene:

*   **Be the best listener you know**

    *   If you're not spending 2 hours a day connecting with your market, you will have 3 good years and then you're finished
    *   At dinner parties, sit down and LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN
    *   The most powerful word in marketing is "YOU"

*   **Work extremely intensely in spurts**

    *   Set a timer for 33.33 minutes and work ONLY the job at hand. NOTHING ELSE! Take a 5 min break then repeat. (I loved this one)

*   **Writers Block - The conscious mind is VERY narrow**

    *   Mozart never ever rewrote
    *   How did he do it?
    *   He composed at a billiard table with a pen. He held the cue ball and threw it randomly. He had to focus on trajectory. While the conscious mind was focused on ball, his unconscious was focused on creativity.

*   **Write to the chimpanzee brain. Simply. Directly.**

    *   You use the chimpanzee brain when reading copy
    *   Use very simple, dramatic and very vivid words
    *   Inside of us we have this hidden chimpanzee
    *   You want the person to look through the copy and see the product inside
    *   Don't let the layout stand out over the copy
    *   No words with more than 3 syllables

*   **Channel demand, never sell**

    *   You are not creating demand, you can only channel demand
    *   If you think you are creating demand for a product you've doomed yourself to failure
    *   The demand has to exist before you walk into the picture
    *   You take the demand and channel it into your product

*   **Think about what your product DOES, not IS**
*   **Make gratification INSTANTANEOUS**
*   **Failing often, and testing big differences shows you are trying hard enough**

## Dane Maxwell - Software Rebel

Dane is a lot younger (30's) than these old guys, but is REALLY smart when it comes to marketing and building software.

He's never been featured onTechcrunch or Mashable, but the dude has created a 500k/year software business without one dime of VC money.

Here’s a couple things you can learn from Dane:

*   Be **CLEAR** not **CLEVER** when writing copy for your site
*   It’s not about your **PRODUCT**, it’s about your **CUSTOMER**
*   If you can describe the customers problem better than they can, then they will assume you have the solution
*   Think of your solution first in terms of the **benefits**. Not the **features**. Every feature is there to get the client a benefit not to get them a feature.

## Neville Medhora - Kopywriting King

Neville is the genius behind AppSumo's email marketing. (AppSumo is like a Groupon for entrepreneurs, it's amazing).

If you've ever received an email from them you know how fantastic they are.

Hilarious, informative, and **MAN** do they get you to buy every time. It's tough to resist.

This next fact blew me away...

Their emails have a **MINIMUM** of 100% open rate, meaning people open these emails again **3 or 4 times**!

Neville has studied all the greats and know what he's doing.

Here's a few things I picked up in his materials:

*   When writing remember this: **NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU** (They care about themselves)
*   Always speak about the benefit for the customer
*   Use the **AIDA** formula to write emails

    *   **Attention** (Grab their attention instantly)
    *   **Interest** (Provide them interested with relevant facts)
    *   **Desire** (Help them see the benefit)
    *   **Action** (Instruct them on what to do next)

*   "The point of the first line is to make them read the second like, and the point of the second line to make them read the third line" - David Ogilvy

<h2 id='dane_maxwell__software_rebel'>Dane Maxwell - Software Rebel</h2>

<p>Dane is a lot younger (30&#8217;s) than these old guys, but is REALLY smart when it comes to marketing and building software.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s never been featured onTechcrunch or Mashable, but the dude has created a 500k/year software business without one dime of VC money.</p>

<p>Here’s a couple things you can learn from Dane:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Be <strong>CLEAR</strong> not <strong>CLEVER</strong> when writing copy for your site</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It’s not about your <strong>PRODUCT</strong>, it’s about your <strong>CUSTOMER</strong></p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you can describe the customers problem better than they can, then they will assume you have the solution</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Think of your solution first in terms of the <strong>benefits</strong>. Not the <strong>features</strong>. Every feature is there to get the client a benefit not to get them a feature. <strong>Check out Danes stuff:</strong></p>

<h2 id='neville_medhora__kopywriting_king'>Neville Medhora - Kopywriting King</h2>

<p>Neville is the genius behind AppSumo&#8217;s email marketing. (AppSumo is like a Groupon for entrepreneurs, it&#8217;s amazing).</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever received an email from them you know how fantastic they are.</p>

<p>Hilarious, informative, and <strong>MAN</strong> do they get you to buy every time. It&#8217;s tough to resist.</p>

<p>This next fact blew me away&#8230;</p>

<p>Their emails have a <strong>MINIMUM</strong> of 100% open rate, meaning people open these emails again <strong>3 or 4 times</strong>!</p>

<p>Neville has studied all the greats and know what he&#8217;s doing.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a few things I picked up in his materials:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>When writing remember this: <strong>NO ONE CARES ABOUT YOU</strong> (They care about themselves)</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Always speak about the benefit for the customer</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Use the <strong>AIDA</strong> formula to write emails</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Attention</strong> (Grab their attention instantly)</li>

<li><strong>Interest</strong> (Provide them interested with relevant facts)</li>

<li><strong>Desire</strong> (Help them see the benefit)</li>

<li><strong>Action</strong> (Instruct them on what to do next)</li>
</ul>
</li>
