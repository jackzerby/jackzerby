        <div class="blog-post-body"><p>I'll always remember how fun it was launching new features at Vimeo.</p>

<p>We'd turn on this really strange instrumental and dance around while Andrew hit the enter button to deploy the code.</p>

<p>However, once it was live we'd all hi-five, walk back to our desks and put our headphones back on.</p>

<p>I'd immediately go to Vimeo blog and scan through the comments, zooming right past the positive ones while cautiously waiting for the first negative comment.</p>

<p>Sure enough, I'd find it.</p>

<p><em>"THIS IS THE LAST STRAW VIMEO - HAVE FUN LOSING ALL YOUR USERS TO YOUTUBE - I'M LEAVING BRO!!!!!!!"</em></p>

<p>300 amazing positive comments + 1 negative comment = <strong>1 negative comment</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>That's critics math.</strong></p>

<p>Even Larry David suffers from critics math, in this article from Rolling Stone.</p>

<p>_One night during his stay (in New York), David went to Yankee Stadium to see a game. His image went up on the big screen as Curb Your Enthusiasm's theme song played over the big speakers. An entire stadium of fans stood and cheered for the hopeless case from Brooklyn. It should have been a life-defining moment, the redemptive final scene in the biopic. But as it turned out, not so much. As David left the stadium, a guy drove by and yelled, "Larry, you suck!" "That's like, literally all he heard," Berg (David's friend) says.</p>

<p>David spent the ride back from the Bronx obsessing over that moment, running it over and over in his mind. It was as if the other 50,000 people, the ones who loved him, didn't exist. "Who's that guy? What was that?" He asked. "Who would do that? Why would you say something like that?"</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>Amazing when you look at the scale of the equation in Larry's case.</p>

<p>49,999 fans cheering + 1 loud mouth = 1 stupid loud mouth that Larry couldn't stop thinking about.</p>

<p>When we launched Flavors, I would do the same thing on Twitter. For every 100 people saying they loved the product, there was always ONE that was mad that our app didn't make them breakfast in bed.</p>

<p>Those few negative comments had zero effect on our bottom line. They didn't provide us with any constructive feedback or offer any helpful insights. They were useless...but they were not HARMLESS.</p>

<p>I spent so much time and energy focused on it. I would have preferred to spend that time creating new features or dishing out more hi-fives, but I all I could think about is how we didn't measure up to freakin @chilldude47's ridiculous demands.</p>

<p>Over the past few weeks, I've had a ton of discussions about this with other makers/creatives/entrepreneurs, and every one of them can relate to this feeling that you need everyone to admire you or you aren't good enough. My friend Anthony, who runs a training program called <em>Genflo</em>, helped me see it much more clearly:</p>

<p><em>"You first need to understand why you can't stop looking at the feedback. Until you grasp that, your non-generative perception wants your attention and can never get enough of it. You can't get rid of this natural constraint, but we can manage it more effectively. The next time you find yourself worrying, ruminating, or losing focus with work, take a step back and question whether its about the work itself or your identity needing your attention. If the latter, write down what you're thinking and read back how silly it sounds."</em></p>

<p>Anthony challenged me to think WHY I'm looking at the feedback. Am I upset because my identity being challenged as a designer? Probably. Once I wrote down on paper <em>"I am not a good designer because @chilldude47 said Flavors is like a burning pile of goat crap"</em>, I realized how ridiculous it was :)</p>

<p><strong>Here are some great articles on feedback, ego and hateraide:</strong></p>
