I wasn't sure what to expect after I pushed it live, but after a couple months we've received a ton of useful feedback. I never thought people would take the time to write something useful AND leave their email address to make sure we could follow up, but they did. Here are some of the most common feedback:

*   I love the service, but it's missing a few key features
*   I love the service, and am just deleting my account to open it under another email address
*   I love the service, but am closing down my business
*   You guys suck and I want to punch all of you in the face
We learned pretty quickly that focusing solely the the number of people deleting their accounts doesn't always tell the whole story.

Here is a screenshot of the spreadsheet that is populated by the Google form:
