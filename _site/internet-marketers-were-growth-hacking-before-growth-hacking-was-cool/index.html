        <div class="blog-post-date">06 Nov 2012</div>
        <div class="blog-post-body"><p>Isn't it exciting when you discover a new corner of the Internet? Spending hours reading every blog post you can, often so bleary eyed at 2am, that you slam your laptop down, stumble into your bedroom, only to pull out your phone and read <em>one last post</em>. My wife can't go to sleep unless I'm done looking at my phone, so she just grumbles passive aggressively till I shut that bad boy down</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>What is this corner you might be asking?</p>

<p>The world of Internet Marketing.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, um Jack, that ish has been around since the nineties. Aren't they those spammy sites that my Dad accidentally signs up for? That's what I thought, till I started reading guys like <a href="http://smartpassiveincome.com">Pat Flynn</a>, <a href="http://mixergy.com/dane-maxwell-zannee-interview/">Dane Maxwell</a>, and <a href="http://internetbusinessmastery.com">Internet Business Mastery</a>. I continually wanted to punch them in the face, mainly because I wish I would have known this stuff earlier.</p>

<p>Here's a couple things that I've learned from pouring over their materials.</p>

<h2>How to target keywords and generate better organic traffic through Google</h2>

<p>Yea I know, SEO has been around since 1952, but hear me out. <a href="http://smartpassiveincome.com">Pat Flynn</a> did a <a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/nichesiteduel/">fantastic series of posts</a> where he and <a href="http://www.tyroneshum.com/">Tyrone Shum</a> challenged each other to create a niche site, get it to the #1 spot in Google, and monetize it. The most interesting part was how they pick keywords to target using a powerful tool called  <a href="http://www.marketsamurai.com/" title="*Market Samurai* href=">Market Samurai</a>. The amazing part of this tool is that it gives you a ridiculously detailed birds eye view of keywords and the competition around them.</p>

<h2>Landing Page design</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.marketingshow.com/">Clay Collins</a> did a bunch of <a href="http://www.marketingshow.com/free-groupon-landing-page-squeeze-page-template/">fantastic posts</a> breaking down some of the most effective landing pages out there. He thoroughly analyzes <a href="http://groupon.com">Groupon</a> and <a href="http://appsumo.com">Appsumo</a>'s use of the double opt-in approach to increase conversions. I love Clay's energy and delivery.</p>

<h2>Finding a market first, then extract the idea</h2>

<p>In an <a href="http://internetbusinessmastery.com/ibm-168-internet-business-passive-income-with-software">interview with Internet Business Mastery</a>, entrepreneur <a href="http://thefoundation.io/sam-ovens-case/">Dane Maxwell</a> of <a href="http://thefoundation.io">Thefoundation.io</a> said that all of his ideas have come from a process he calls <em>idea extraction</em>. He will ask someone in a potential market questions like <em>what's the most important thing you do at your job</em> and <em>what's the most frustrating part of your job?</em>. All of these questions lead up to what Dane calls <em>finding the pain</em>. I love Dane's approach because aligns perfectly with what I've read about Steve Blanks Customer Development process, which is also described in <a href="http://theleanstartup.com">The Lean Startup</a>, by <a href="www.startuplessonslearned.com">Eric Ries</a>. The recent fervor around the Lean Startup movement was built around <em>getting out of the building</em> and talking to customers, yet Dane has been doing that the whole time and getting amazing results.</p>

<h2>How to outsource mundane tasks</h2>

<p>After blazing through Tim Ferris's <a href="fourhourworkweek.com">Four Hour Workweek</a> (I know, I'm late to the game), I decided to take his advice on outsourcing mundane tasks and focus on tasks where I can bring the most value. I had an idea for a startup-kit daily email which would be generated from a list of links I had in a Google spreadsheet. I went to <a href="http://odesk.com">Odesk.com</a>, looked up a developer with a high rating, sent him the details, and by the next morning I had a fully functional Python script that worked perfectly. It only cost me $100.</p>

<p>Bam.</p>

<h2>Cashflow and Boostrapping</h2>

<p>If you read TechCrunch, you learn pretty quickly that startup culture <a href="http://birch.co/post/31057574153/congratulating-entrepreneurs-on-raising-money">celebrates raising millions of dollars</a> from big name investors. In the internet marketing world, it's all about one thing: CASHFLOW. What a novel idea; create a business that actually generates revenue AND profit. That's not sexy nor does it get you into cool parties, but it does create much more freedom. These guys are creating serious revenue and from what I gather have never raised a dime from investors. When I discovered that Pat Flynn <a href="http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/my-income-reports/">posts his monthly income breakdown</a> on his blog, and my jaw dropped.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why, but the startup world and the internet marketing world seem to have very little crossover. Maybe it's just me, but I think both sides would benefit from each other in big ways.</p>
