        <div class="blog-post-date">06 Nov 2013</div>
        <div class="blog-post-body"><p>I remember the first time I heard the word niche site. It was last year around Christmas and I had discovered a couple very popular bloggers who run businesses teaching people who to make niche sites.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>What the heck is a niche site?</p>

<p>This is from an actual post from a popular niche site blogger.</p>

<p><em>1. Find a niche and build a site.
2. Get traffic.
3. Traffic clicks on affiliate links or ads strategically placed on the site.
4. Make money</em></p>

<p>I was sucked in <strong>immediately</strong>. See, I had spent the last 5 years building 2 different startups, working 12 hour days literally dreaming in code, alongside nightmares of it all falling apart.</p>

<p>The prospect of spending a few weeks of doing keyword research, building a Wordpress blog, filling it with "spun" content (if you don't know what that is look it up, it's borderline plagiarism) and spreading "backlinks" all over the web, seemed like a dream come true.</p>

<p>Eventually, I stumbled across several different income reports, with some making over <strong>50k a month</strong> in affiliate sales alone.</p>

<p>I quickly realized they were making MORE money per month than any startup I knew (profit, not revenue), WITHOUT actually building a product that solved a problem.</p>

<p>I watched/listened/read everything I could on the subject, but something just didn't feel right.</p>

<p>These bloggers were making a ridiculously disproportionate amount of money TEACHING people how to make money building niche sites and a fraction of that revenue was made with niche sites, the very thing they were teaching people how to build.</p>

<p>I concluded that the best way to MAKE money online is to TEACH people how to make money online. Sigh...</p>

<p>Forget about building software that solves problems, or building businesses that generate real value.</p>

<p>Imagine pitching that to Paul Graham.</p>

<p>If I dig down deep and reveal how I feel while I'm writing this, it's jealousy. My jealousy was rooted in the fact that they took a cough, <em>"different"</em> route making ridiculous amounts of money, while my partners and I were slogging away in the <a href="http://andrewchen.co/2012/09/10/after-the-techcrunch-bump-life-in-the-trough-of-sorrow/">SaaS trough of sorrow</a>. However, as I started building niche sites, I realized the feeling was completely empty. There were no smiling customers, only anonymous clicks on my Adsense ads. This was not something I could be proud of at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I'm sure there will be many of you who don't agree, and may be thinking the following:</p>

<p>BUT JACK niche sites DO solve a problem, they help people find information in their particular niche.
BUT JACK I put in 12 hour days building niche sites, so don't tell me it's easy or that I haven't worked hard.
BUT JACK I get emails all the time from users who love my niche sites.</p>

<p>The above statements may all be true for you so I'll end with this:</p>

<p>If you're goal is to build a niche site empire, fantastic. Just do it with the right intentions: To provide amazing value to your viewers.</p>
