        <div class="blog-post-date">06 Nov 2013</div>
        <div class="blog-post-body"><p>I remember the first time I heard the word niche site. It was last year around Christmas and I had discovered some very popular bloggers who teach people how to make these things called niche sites.</p>

<p>What the heck is a niche site?</p>

<p>This is from an actual post from a popular niche site blogger.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Find a niche and build a site.</em></li>
<li><em>Get traffic.</em></li>
<li><em>Traffic clicks on affiliate links or ads strategically placed on the site.</em></li>
<li><em>Make money</em></li>
</ol>


<p>I was sucked in <strong>immediately</strong>. See, I had spent the last 5 years building 2 different startups, working 12 hour days literally dreaming in code, alongside nightmares of it all falling apart at any moment.</p>

<p>The prospect of spending a few weeks of doing keyword research, building a Wordpress blog, filling it with "spun" content (if you don't know what that is look it up, it's borderline plagiarism) and spreading "backlinks" all over the web, seemed like a dream come true.</p>

<p>Eventually, I stumbled across several different income reports, with some making over <strong>50k a month</strong> in affiliate sales alone.</p>

<p>I quickly realized they were making MORE money per month than any startup I knew (profit, not revenue), WITHOUT actually building a product that solved a problem.</p>

<p>I watched/listened/read everything I could on the subject, but something just didn't feel right.</p>

<p>These bloggers were making a ridiculously disproportionate amount of money TEACHING people how to make money building niche sites and a fraction of that revenue was actually made with niche sites, the very thing they were teaching people how to build.</p>

<p>I concluded that the best way to MAKE money online is to TEACH people how to make money online. Sigh...</p>

<p>Forget about building software that solves problems, or building businesses that generate real value.</p>

<p>Imagine pitching that to Paul Graham.</p>

<p>If I dig down deep and reveal how I feel while I'm writing this, it's jealousy. My jealousy was rooted in the fact that they took a cough, <em>"different"</em> route making ridiculous amounts of money, while my partners and I were slogging away in the <a href="http://andrewchen.co/2012/09/10/after-the-techcrunch-bump-life-in-the-trough-of-sorrow/">SaaS trough of sorrow</a>. However, as I started building niche sites, I realized the feeling was completely empty. There were no smiling customers, only anonymous clicks on my Adsense ads.</p>

<p>I'm sure there will be many of you who don't agree, and may be thinking the following:</p>

<p><strong>BUT JACK</strong> niche sites DO solve a problem, they help people find information in their particular niche.
<strong>BUT JACK</strong> I put in 12 hour days building niche sites, so don't tell me it's easy or that I haven't worked hard.
<strong>BUT JACK</strong> I get emails all the time from users who love my niche sites.</p>

<p>The above statements may all be true for you so I'll end with this:</p>

<p>If you're goal is to build a niche site empire, fantastic. Just do it with the right intentions: <em>To provide amazing value to your viewers.</em></p>

<p><em>Update:</em></p>

<p>Mat had a great point in an email exchange we had this morning. Why does one need to put such a concrete label on startup world, marketing world, niche world? He's right, a lot of us have our feet in all different areas, so I would say we all belong to the internet business world. Also, there are plenty examples of startups who have raised a ridiculous amount of money, built a beautifully designed product that doesn't solve a problem or add value, and eventually sell to Google and ride off on a golden donkey.</p>

<p>I also think that Pat Flynn's new food truck site is right on the money. So thankfully Pat is setting a good example when it comes to building niche sites. Same with Justin and Joe at Empire Flippers, they personally vet every site that they sell to make sure it's high quality.</p>
