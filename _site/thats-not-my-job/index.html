        <div class="blog-post-date">16 Jul 2013</div>
        <div class="blog-post-body"><p>I was volunteering one morning setting up a sound system for an event and we were having issues with the screen projector. I asked a young lad (love using that word) helping us set up the stage a question.</p>

<p><em>"Hey (we'll call him Jim) Jim, quick favor if you don't mind"</em></p>

<p>Jim slowly sauntered over like freakin Dilbert.</p>

<p><em>"yeaa?"</em></p>

<p><em>"I'm having some issues getting this projector going, would you mind seeing if you could get it working while I set up these mic stands?"</em></p>

<p><em>"Umm, cough, well, that's not my job...that's Susy's job."</em></p>

<p>His words smashed through my ears with a dull thud. I could not believe he just uttered those words. The blood rushed to my ears and all I could hear was a high pitched sine wave.</p>

<p><strong>I threw down the mic stand, ran over and dropped kicked him right in the mouth.</strong></p>

<p>That was totally true, except for the fact that it is not. Obviously I wasn't that angry...I'm trying to prove my point in how ridiculous that statement was.</p>

<p>You may be thinking, well maybe that wasn't his job. You'd be right. However that's not the issue. The issue is that he didn't offer to solve the problem.</p>

<p>I didn't ask if he could fix it himself, I asked if he could fix the problem. Which may mean him going and finding the person who knows how to fix it. He could troubleshoot on his super sweet iPhone, call support, etc...</p>

<p>Truth is I'm not mad at the guy (seriously I'm not). In fact I dropped the ball by not somehow explaining/demonstrating (tactfully) that leadership is about solving problems, and sometimes that means gathering resources outside of your own abilities. Now that I wrote that it does sound kinda condescending, but I couldn't think of a way to explain it to him at that moment.</p>

<p><strong>We're all paid to solve problems, and if we continually duck problem-solving opportunities, it will be a long rough road.</strong></p>

<p>Life in startups is an especially good example of this principle. When you have a small team of 4-6 people, everyone has to help solve issues that come up. You're a developer and a customer has a support question? Answer it, or find someone who has the answer. You're a marketing director and a customer has a code question? Get all the details you can, and help connect them with a dev who has the answer.</p>

<p>Let's say you're straight out of college and your boss asks you to do something that you have no idea how to do. If you come back to him and say something like <em>"Based on the task you gave me, I have 2 solutions. Since this may be out of my area of expertise, I've talked to a couple people within the company that will be able to help us get this task done quickly and efficiently. If that doesn't work, I've also researched a great app that can do this for a really low monthly investment (don't say cost, it's all about ROI baby)"</em></p>

<p>Obviously you want to say it in your own voice, but the whole idea is that you've shown you're a problem solver.</p>

<p>Imagine saying *"That's not my job, you didn't pay me to do that, that's not what I agreed to when I signed on!" *</p>

<p>Good luck with that.</p>

<p>You may be saying <em>"BUT JACK WHAT ABOUT BOSSES WHO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE. I'VE HAD BOSSES THAT HAVE TOTALLY ABUSED THEIR EMPLOYEES!!"</em></p>

<p>Slavery was outlawed a long time ago. You are an <em>"at-will"</em> employee, meaning you can get the heck out of there <em>"at-will"</em>, anytime you wish.</p>

<p>At Hiidef, we have some amazing team members. Brent, Katie and Chad are always willing to step up and help us solve problems.</p>

<p>When you find people like that, HOLD ON TO THEM.</p>

<p><strong>Now get out there and solve some problems!</strong></p>
