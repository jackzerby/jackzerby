One thing we both have in common is hustle. We both want to excel in every aspect of our lives and are obsessed with living to our full potential. But like all border-line OCD success fanatics, we struggle with the day to day distractions of TV, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest (cough, did I say Pinterest? woops...)

I recently read an article about a guy who [hired someone to punch him in the face every time he checked Facebook](http://hackthesystem.com/blog/why-i-hired-a-girl-on-craigslist-to-slap-me-in-the-face-and-why-it-quadrupled-my-productivity/). I briefly considered hiring Charlie to do the same thing, but realized I'd be dead after 10 minutes of Facebook wall checking twitches.

We agreed that accountability is the key, so we set up a system to track our productivity.

## Step 1 - Set up a Google Form

I went over to [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com) and [created a form](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzgaUOW6GIs) with several questions.

*   What time did I wake up?
*   Did I check Facebook more than once today?
*   How much TV did I watch today?
*   Did I listen to at least 2 podcasts or leadership cd's today?
*   Did I spend more than 1 10 minute session reading useless blogs, news sites, etc...?
*   How would I rate my day today? (1 - 5)
*   Notes about my day
[![Hustle](http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-9.46.56-PM.png "Hustle")](http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-06-at-9.46.56-PM.png)

## Use IFTTT to create automation

IFTTT is an amazing tool that allows you to create "recipes" that combine various web apps to do automated tasks. I create a recipe to send an email to Charlie and I from my Gmail account every night at 8pm. This email contains a link a to the form to fill out.

[![ifttt](http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ifttt-300x233.png "ifttt")](http://s92309880.onlinehome.us/Niche_StartupKit/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/ifttt.png)

## Check the results

After a couple days, check the results and see how both parties have faired. This is the key to the whole process; it's open and honest. Anytime you have a bad day, you realize that someone else will be seeing it, which makes you think twice anytime you want to skip off to check Twitter for the 4,000 time. (Results are blurred to protect the innocent)

## Reflections

This experiment has definitely improved my productivity, but I admit it's tough to keep up with. There are some days that you just don't feel like filling out the form because you knew you had a day filled with distractions. I feel like it could be even more effective if we invited a couple other people into the process, but we wanted to test it with two first.

It doesn't have to center around productivity either, this could work for dieting, fitness, smoking, etc...

So what are you waiting for?
