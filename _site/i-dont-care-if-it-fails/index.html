        <div class="blog-post-body"><p>If you're a designer, say that out loud. Does that ring uncomfortably true?</p>

<p>Maybe you're not a designer, let's say you're a developer.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought <em>"I don't care if it fails, as long as the code is beautiful and it works flawlessly"</em>?</p>

<p>I'm going to write this from a designer and developer's perspective because that's what I do all day. There have been countless times in my design career where I have said things like:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"Crap. That last word doesn't fit very well in that column. Eh, let's ditch it."</em></p>

<p><em>"That help text looks really bad there. Only an idiot would not know how to do that. Let's ditch it".</em></p>

<p><em>"We've had a ton of complaints about [feature xyz], but without it, the page would look really unbalanced."</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I know some of you designers reading this have said similar things, SO DON'T GET ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY ON ME OR I WILL TURN THIS BUS AROUND.</p>

<p>The developer side of me has spent THOUSANDS of hours "cleaning" up code. Just scan through my GitHub commits and you'll see extremely detailed commits messages like "Admin Cleanup".</p>

<p><strong>Here are some gems I've said on the developer side:</strong></p>

<blockquote><p><em>"Hey [customer x], we just rewrote the entire backend of your favorite app. Half of your features are gone, but the site is SO MUCH FASTER NOW. Like 2ms off of load time! BAM!"</em></p>

<p><em>"We can't push because I'm in the middle of renaming 785 class names, from the prefix </em>app-<em> to the prefix </em>apps-<em>, so just hold off on those critical fixes for a couple years."</em></p>

<p><em>"I think we need to rewrite the entire site from the ground up. It will be SO much easier if we just rip everything out and start clean. We won't be able to push anything out for a bit (probably 10 years), but in the end we'll thank ourselves".</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I've never punched myself in the face before, but I am super close to doing that right now as I read back through these wonderful words of wisdom I've espoused.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of tough questions I should probably ask myself. Maybe you can relate to some of them.</p>

<p><strong>1. Do I care more about impressing other designers, developers and coworkers than I do about my customers?</strong></p>

<p>Just browse around Dribbble for a couple hours and you'll see a bunch of designers slapping each other on the back for a KILLER job on that 3D beveled embossed volume button with comments like:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"Hey man, killer button, where can I download the app?"</em></p>

<p><em>"The app? Cough, yeah I mean this is still a mockup, and yeah I mean I'm sure everyone will love this app, I mean it has like 546 likes, so yeah definitelyâ€¦"</em></p>

<p><em>"Oh ok cool, so no one's ever actually used this app, it's just a picture? RAD!"</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I'm kinda being a bit of Debbie Downer, but maybe it's because I do the same things (just not on Dribbble, I show it to my Mom).</p>

<p>I'm really trying to break this mindset, but it's really tough.</p>

<p>Essentially, I have to be comfortable with the phrase <em>"Am I willing to sacrifice the approval of my peers for the satisfaction of my customers?"</em></p>

<p>Maybe we struggle with the fact that everything we ship has our name attached to it, and when we look back at our body of work, we can be proud.</p>

<p>But WHAT we're proud of is the difference between a career of accolades or a career of significance.</p>

<p>If we're proud of the fact that our designs have improved the lives of tens, hundreds, thousands or even millions of people, then we're on the right track.</p>

<p>If we're proud that our mockup got 1000 likes on Dribbble, then we should hand over our badge and gun. (Awesome Die Hard reference)</p>

<p><strong>2. Maybe I have a bit of OCD? (ok, probably a lot)</strong></p>

<p>One pixel is all it takes. Just one tiny pixel and I will not go to sleep until it is aligned correctly. Countless times I've told my wife Marisa "five more minutes." She goes to bed, and there I am, hunched over my laptop in my underwear, eyes bleary, fighting the CSS behind ONE stubborn pixel.</p>

<p>Developers, have you spent hours naming a class or a function, then renaming it, then naming it again, then finally giving up, taking a Xanax, only to come back 2 hours later and rename it once more?</p>

<p>There are starving kids in Africa and we are stressing over a name of a function that handles Facebook Connect. Cool story, brah.</p>

<p>I get why having clean code is important; I've seen enormous code bases that look like my 11-month-old's highchair after a bowl of beef stew. But there has to be a line drawn somewhere, and to be honest, I still can't draw it.</p>

<p>Maybe our obsession with control and detail is an escape from our lives outside of the computer, where things are often out of our control. Relationships and family are messy, and unlike code, we can't control them in a text editor.</p>

<p><strong>3. Do I really apply "lean" principles?</strong></p>

<p>I love reading about The Lean Startup. I've read everything Eric Ries has written, watched every talk he's ever talked, camped out in Steve Blanks backyard (wait what?), read The Startup Owner's Manual on a flight to London (wow, saying a <em>"flight to London"</em> sounds really baller), and have Ash Maurya Running Lean posters on my wall.</p>

<p>But when it comes down to shipping something quickly to learn faster, I freeze.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>"Hold up, we can't ship that yet! I think I remember Steve Blank saying that the proper line height is needed before you can find a scalable and repeatable business model."</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Everything about that philosophy makes perfect sense to me. Why would I waste precious hours of my life designing something nobody wants?</p>

<p>Maybe I should worry less about em-dashes and more about empathy. Empathy for the users who are trying navigating my design, not throwing their hands up in disgust at my poorly placed drop cap.</p>

<p>So as I finish this post I realized I haven't given any advice on how to overcome these tendencies. Some of you may even think they aren't bad at all. To those people, I will say in the word of Dr. Phil: <em>"How's that workin for ya?"</em></p>

<p>For now, I'm just going to let this stuff sink in, and maybe I'll follow up with a perfectly-spaced, HTML5 golden ratio-ed blog post on how I overcame these mountains of ridiculousness.</p>
