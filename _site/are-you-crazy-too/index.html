I asked him a question to see if I was crazy.

*I am crazy? Most days, I'll be listening to a TedTalk podcast on my laptop while I'm working, then **sprint** to the bathroom and start reading a business book on my phone (my wife yells me for staying in there so long), then sprint **back** to laptop, listen to a Stanford Leadership Podcast, then **jump** in the car to pick up my son from school and **immediately** put on a Startup School talk from Seth Godin.* (I turn it off when he gets in so DON'T YOU JUDGE ME, haha...)

*Then there are times when I'll walk around Target with my phone up to my ear listening to a Dave Ramsey seminar while Marisa shops (which could take hours). Later on that evening I'll fall asleep with a headphone in my ear listening to a Mixergy interview...(until I finally hear the obvious _put that phone away_ sigh from Marisa)*

I knew I wasn't alone when Bobby jumped up, yelled _**HECK YEA**_ and high-fived me...

This is the whole reason I write this newsletter.

I **KNOW** there's got to be other **crazies** out there that want to make a real impact on the world and **LOVE** learning as much as they possibly can... _whenever_ and _wherever_ they can.

The most exciting thing about the web to me is the sheer amount of amazing **FREE** information out there for the taking.

Podcasts are the perfect learning method, because you can listen **AND** do other things at the same time.

Listen while you're at **work**.

If you can't listen while you **work**, then **driving** is the perfect time.

If you don't **drive**, then listen on the **walk** to work.

If you don't **walk** to work then listen on the **train**, **bus** or **subway**.

If you don't do any of those, **you've got other problems...**

If you get in the habit of listening **_every day_**, it will change your life and your business.
