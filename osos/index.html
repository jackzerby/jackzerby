                     <p class="font-g">In the United States, there are 
                    currently over 2 Million wounded 
                    veterans... men and women that have 
                    risked everything for our freedom.</p>
                    
                    <p>From physical trauma to PTSD, For
                    many readjustment back into the civilian 
                    life has proven difficult to not only 
                    themselves but also their families.</p>
                    
                    <p>As a marine, I know the unique 
                    skills and training our military members 
                    receive. And as photographers, we've used
                    this training to discover a new method of
                    viewing and capturing the world around 
                    us.</p>
                    
                    <p>At One Shot One Skill, we see a 
                    way to help our warriors by equipping 
                    them with a new weapon for life. We've 
                    developed a program and curriculum 
                    that helps our vets to take their military 
                    and combat training and apply it directly 
                    to photography and the Arts 
                    Empowering them with RENEWED 
                    purpose, vision and source of income.</p>
                    
                    <p>We are seeking <strong>$100,000</strong> from 
                    individuals to corporations to get 
                    through our first year of operations... </p>
                    
                    <p>With those funds we will be 
                    equipping veterans with cameras, 
                    laptops, and training, the completion of 
                    an E-learning platform and establishing a
                    sustainable social enterprise.</p>
                    
                    <p>We are also looking for mentors... 
                    photographers who want to make a
