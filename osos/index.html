                    <h2>What is the OSOS Method?</h2>
                    <p class="font-g">When I got out of the service and started my photography career I used the same discipline acquired during basic training to understand this new craft. I <strong>devoured</strong> all the training I could, online and offline, but I still felt like something was missing.</p>
                    <p>All that changed when I <strong>stopped seeing my camera as a camera and started seeing it as a rifle</strong>. I began to stalk shots, control my breathing, realizing that every moment was a moment in time that needed to be captured before it was gone forever.</p>
                    <p>There is power in capturing a moment. It is a great honor to be a photographer. We have a responsibility to ensure the moments we capture are not just pictures.</p>
                    <p><strong>The One Shot One Kill Method (OSOS)</strong> forces photographers to stalk their shots will military precision, anticipate moments before they occur and reduce the total number of shots taken. As a result, OSOS allows the shooter to reduce total editing time, increase the quality of final images and avoid the embarrassment of missing the perfect shot.</p>
                    <p>Since developing this method, I've built a successful career, being able to charge upwards of <strong>$1000 an hour </strong>for shots a normal photographer wouldn't be able to take.</p>
