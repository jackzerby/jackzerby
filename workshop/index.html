                    <p>Welcome to <strong>Workshop</strong>.</p>
                    <p>We're creating an entrepreneur factory in <strong>State College</strong>. A place where ideas mean <strong>nothing</strong>, execution is <strong>everything</strong>, and the <strong>#1 thing</strong> needed to have a business is a <strong>paying customer</strong>. We're not looking for the smartest, most talented or most successful people. We're looking for those who aren't afraid to <strong>work hard</strong> and <strong>learn</strong>.</p> 
                    <p>Imagine a place where you're <strong>surrounded</strong> by people like you, who spend every waking hour with a <strong>burning</strong> desire to pursue their dreams and build something amazing. People who <strong>KNOW</strong> they were built for something big.</p>
                    <p>I'm <a href="http://jackzerby.com"><strong>Jack</strong></a>, and I'm one of those crazy people. In fact it's <strong>3am</strong> as I'm writing this because I can't sleep thinking about how <strong>freakin awesome</strong> this is going to be.</p>
                    <p>You were probably told about this by someone who thinks you've got what it takes to be a member. It's simple, for founding members it's $25 dollars a month and you won't get charged until we officially launch.
