                    <h3>Why take this class?</h3>
                    <p class="font-i">Are you frustrated by the fact that you have an AMAZING product but have no idea why more people aren't signing up or buying? Does it drive you NUTS that people are coming to your site, looking around for 3 seconds, and leaving for your competition? It took me awhile to figure it out, but once I did, it changed my mindset forever.
                    <p class="font-i">Customers only care about ONE thing: what can it do for THEM! They want to know what your product DOES, not what it IS. They don't want to hear about your 1,854 features. They want to believe that your product can make their life easier.</p>
                    <p class="font-i"><em>"Yea yea, but JACK I've heard all this stuff before! Boooorrring"
                    "If I hear one more person say "Lean Startup" I'm going to quit the internet and live in the woods."</em>
                    <p class="font-i">That's what I thought too.</p>
                    <p class="font-i">Until I started studying legends of copywriting industry.
                    Old school writers of the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's.
                    Guys with really sweet beards and awesome 80's hair.
                    These dudes were talking lean WAY before it was hipster.</p>

                    <h3>Why listen to me?</h3>
                    <p class="font-i">I've done every single thing these guys talk about wrong, over and over and over.
                    I've seen what works and what doesn't.
                    We built Flavors to over 720,000 users doing a lot of things wrong, and I kick myself every time I learn something that could have DRAMATICALLY increased that number.</p>
                    <p class="font-i">I also saw first hand, as an early member of the Vimeo team, what led to the vibrant community that it is today.
                    But mainly, my job is to inspire you to learn from the greats of the past and get you so fired up to dig so deep into their material that you can't sleep until you've read everything they've written.</p>

                    <p class="font-i">You will walk away with how to build an insanely effective landing page.</p>
                    <p class="font-i">You'll also know how to fix your current landing page (if you have one), and start to see other landing pages through an entirely different lens.</p>
