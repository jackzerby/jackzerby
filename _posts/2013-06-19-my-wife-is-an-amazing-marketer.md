I'm gonna use a lot of Chris Farley double quotes here...

Anyone who's married knows the initial awkwardness of combining bank accounts, if even if you didn't do that *(good luck)*, you still have to start looking at what was once "your" money, as "our" money. Earlier in our marriage we used to fight all the time about things we bought. Marisa would come home with a new pair of shoes *(how many do you freakin need anyway, I buy one pair per year)*, so I would go out and buy a new guitar. BOOM I SHOWED HER! What we didn't realize is that spending "our" money to get back at each other was pretty ridiculous.

That is until we started tracking our spending within a budget. *(stay with me, I have a point)*. 

We each have what we call "blast money". We can blast this money on anything we want, and it's worked fantastic for 4 years.

But what happens when Marisa wants to buy things for "us"? Things like dining room tables, dressers, beds, GIANT mortgages *(2008 was a great year to buy...cough)*. I'd like to think of myself as "frugal", but Marisa just calls me cheap. In order to convince me to agree to buy that ridiculously expensive Pottery Barn dining room table she uses several very sophisticated marketing techniques.






##Price Anchoring
![Price](/assets/img/blog-wife-1.jpg)
When Steve Jobs pitched the iPad he started with "The pundits think we'll price it at $1000, which is code for $999. I'm thrilled to announce that we priced it not at $999, but at just $499.". The crowd went WILD. "HIGH FIVES YEAAA! STEVE WHERE CAN I BUY THIS AMAZINGLY PRICED ITEM!" Steve was a master at this concept.

As defined by Wikipedia, "Anchoring is a cognitive bias that describes the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered *(the "anchor")* when making decisions."

**Conversation**
>*   "Hey honey, guess what?" *(the setup)*
>*   "What..." *(I'm probably on my phone)*
>*   "I just got an AMAZING deal on a new coffee table for us. 50% off!" *(setting the anchor)*
>*   "50% off of what..." *(still not looking up)*
>*   "Well it was marked down a couple times, and the lady at the store said it was originally $2000!" *(another anchor)*
>*   "Umm so how much was it?" *($2000 dollars just got my attention)*
>*   "After the 50% off, the markdowns, I got this $2000 table for only $800!"
>*   "Ah, ok, well maybe that's not such a bad deal after all" *(ug, she got me)*

If she would have just come right out and said she got a coffee table for $800, I would have flipped and said we could have used that $800 for bread and warm milk for our little children. In other words, I would have said no.






##Risk Reversal

Legendary Direct Marketer Dan Kennedy refers to Risk Reversal as "the most powerful sales technique in the world".
The idea behind risk reversal is that people don't want to look stupid. When they buy from you, they want to make sure you will follow through and deliver the value promised. The most common risk reversal technique is a guarantee.

**Conversation**
>*   "Soooo Jackie, I have a question..." *(Jackie is what Marisa calls me when I'm about to be asked something I may not like)*
>*   "Oh boy" *(I know what's coming)*
>*   "So if you don't like it we can totally take it back within 30 days, no worries" *(reducing risk)*
>*   "Umm, what is it?"
>*   "So I found the most beautiful dining room table from Pottery Barn"
>*   "How much?" *(Notice how I don't ask any questions about the table, just how much it costs)*
>*   "Threee umm thousand umm dollars AND IT INCLUDES CHAIRS, so we won't have to buy chairs separately!"
>*   "For a table? I'll go to Lowes and make one for $200" *(pshh yea right Jack)*
>*   "Look, there's a 0 down interest free payment plan, where we can just break up the payments without taking a big chunk from savings" *(This may have worked, but I HATE debt, so this fell flat with me)*
>*   "We are DEFINITELY not financing a table" *(tough guy pose)*
>*   "OK fine, then let's just buy it in cash, set it up in the dining room, and if we don't like it after 30 days, we ship it back, no big deal at all" *(the closer)*
>*   "I guess that'll work..."



##Social Proof
![Social](/assets/img/blog-wife-3.jpg)
This is a powerful marketing concept that plays on our desire to validate our own actions with similar actions of others. You could also think of it as when your Mom asked you "if Billy and all the other kids jumped off a cliff..." You get the idea. Some companies use celebrity endorsements, others may display well-known company logos they are associated with on their homepage. Facebook is a haven for social proof. Your friends share what they are eating, where they went on vacation, and other various other humblebrags. Watch how Marisa uses peer social proof to close a deal with me.

**Conversation**
>*   "OMG did you see the anniversary ring so and so bought so and so?"
>*   "Psh, probably financed it for 30 years" *(so bitter)*
>*   "Well he must do pretty well because that's gotta be over 2 carats" *(she knows that one gets me every time)*
>*   "My love is all you need" *(haha)*
>*   "Well I just thought it would be an investment in our marriage, ya know, to have something I could wear and hand down to our daughter" *(laying on the guilt)*
>*   "Where did so and so buy it?" *(coming around)*
>*   "He bought it at Tiffanys, and she said the quality was amazing and the service was impeccable" *(so is the markup)*
>*   "Ok fine, we can go look this weekend" *(sigh...)*



##Upselling
![Upselling](/assets/img/blog-wife-4.jpg)
There are 2 ways most businesses make money, finding new customers, and selling to existing customers. It's much more expensive to gain a new customer than it is to sell to an existing customer. In cross-selling you offer the customer related items, and up-selling you offer a more expensive item or upgrade.

**Conversation**
>*   "We need an SUV"
>*   "Why?"
>*   "Honey, we have two kids smashed into the back of a Honda Accord"
>*   "It's cozy..." *(nice one Jack)*
>*   "Let's look at Acura's" *(for crying out loud)*
>*   "Let's look at Datsun's" *(tried to think of the cheapest car out there)*
>*   "We can get a Datsun, and it would eventually break down and we'd have to get another one. So would you rather spend more money now on the Acura and have it last, or go cheap and have to replace it a year from now?" *(man she's good)*
>*   "Ug, you're right, ok fine, let's go with the Acura" 



Timeless marketing principles can be found everywhere, even your spouse. Those with kids know that children are by FAR the best marketers on the planet. They almost ALWAYS get what they want.
