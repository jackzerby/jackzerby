If you haven't you read Paul Grahams article ["Do Things That Don't Scale"](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html), stop reading this email and do it now.

Picture Ben Stiller...do it...do it...

Here's a personal story that illustrates what Paul says in that article.

After a tough soccer practice in High School, my teammate Dom offered to drive some of us up to the front of the school to get our cars. As the six of us piled in Doms 91' Hyundai, I realized there was no more room to squeeze.

"Zerby, just sit on the back of the car, it's just up the road, you'll be fine".

I reluctantly grabbed my stuff, pulled myself up on the trunk and held on with one hand facing the road behind. As Dom started down the road, I started to tense up, realizing that he was getting faster.

As we approached a right-hand curve in the road, Dom floored it. My hand slipped off almost instantly and everything went to slow-motion Matrix style.

I still remember thinking that I need to SOMEHOW turn around and run as fast as I could. (Totally doable.)

Turns out you can't jump off a car and immediately bust into an all out 15 mph sprint.

SMACK! I skidded across the pavement and ripped all the skin off both of my hands as well as my right eyebrow off.

Don't worry, I was fine after 2 weeks, but was crushed by the fact that now I'd never be a teen model. (Umm what?)

**ZERBY WHAT THE HECK KIND OF A STORY WAS THAT?**

Just hold on there Captain America, I have a point.

Most new entrepreneurs (including myself) will look at giant startups going 100mph and think that the founders magically had an idea, hit the ground running at 90mph and burst through the finish line 3 hours later with a billion dollars.

However, just like in my car story, you can't take the leap and expect to hit the ground running full speed.

Take my friend Anthony Casalena, Founder of Squarespace. Anthony launched Squarespace from his college dorm in 2004 and ran it alone for three years, doing everything from customer support all the way to systems engineering. Squarespace now has 190 team members and is powering MILLIONS of websites.

My point is this: Most of the companies we idolize started at a snails pace, coughing up a lung and slogging away at a 12 minute mile. Once they hit their stride amazing things happened.
