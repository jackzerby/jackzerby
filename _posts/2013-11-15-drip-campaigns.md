I've been diving deep into a ton of content from Nathan Barry and Patrick Mckenzie, and both of them are masters at the drip campaign.

What's a drip campaign? (Sounds like that freakin leaky shower head in our bathroom Marisa keeps asking me to fix.)

A drip campaign is a series of emails that are delivered automatically over a period of time.

**What can I do with a drip campaign?**

Imagine you run a business around crafts.

You could create an 8 email sequence delivered over 30 days that teaches someone how to create crafts for birthday parties.

At the end of every email, you could ask a question like "What's the most frustrating thing about crafts and birthday parties?" (terrible question, but you get the idea).

Imagine how many conversations you'll start, but better yet, how much you'll LEARN from your audience.

**What's the point of a drip campaign?**

The point is educate and bring value to your audience. Yes, there will be selling involved, but by the end of the 30 days they will have received SO much value from you, they can't help but want to thank you in some way, either by buying something or by spreading the word about how awesome you are.

**Why are these important?**

How many times have you signed up for a "private beta" application in January, and then finally heard from them again in November?

10 months have gone by and you haven't heard anything from them. Now all of a sudden they email you and say HEY WERE LAUNCHING YAY!!

Most of the time you can't even remember who they are or what you signed up for.

Imagine if they had built a drip campaign that emailed you every week with super valuable content.

By the time they announced their launch you would already have a super warm fuzzy happy feeling about them.
