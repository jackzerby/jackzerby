This past month I'm starting a new habit. At 6am every morning, <del>I hit snooze and go back to bed</del> I wake up, open my laptop and write for 1 hour.

Sometimes I write furiously and write over 1000 words, but most days I sit there without knowing what to write. I'm realizing that the most important part is not always _what_ I write, but the _act_ of writing. When I'm stuck, sometimes I'll just start writing whatever comes into my mind, and most times while I'm doing this, I'll find something interesting to write about. I often find myself typing in a zombie like state, and then BOOM an idea hits me and I'll write like a freakin jack-rabbit.

I was really inspired by Nathan Barry, who wrote 1000 words a day for an entire year. Here's a breakdown of what he accomplished:

*   29,053 words - The App Design Handbook
*   35,684 words - Designing Web Applications
*   43,535 words - Authority
*   68,181 words (71 posts) - Blog*   35,154 words - Guest posts
*   3,429 words - The Productivity Manifesto
*   28,900 words - Email courses
*   11,004 words - Chapter for Smashing Magazine’s Mobile Book
*   11,504 words - Unpublished content
*   **266,444 words - Total**

Can you imagine what you'd accomplish by writing almost 300,000 words in a year? Not mention how much better of a writer you'd be.

**Why is writing important?**

I can't believe I actually wrote that question, because it's also like asking "why is reading important?". It's important because it requires you to organize and distill your thoughts into some sort of coherency. By practicing the art of writing, you strengthen your communication muscle, which ultimately makes you a better marketer, designer, teacher or CEO. Most of our daily tasks in this industry involve taking complex concepts and simplifying it for the end user, and one of the best ways to hone this ability is to write..._a lot_.

**Finding your voice**

Finding your voice is about being honest and authentic, no BS. How did I start finding my voice? When I started to write how I talk. I tend to be very dramatic and sarcastic when I talk, so once I started writing like that, everything came so much easier. You'll know you're being authentic when the words just start spilling on the page in an almost rhythmic flow.

p.s. I wrote this article a few weeks ago and my 6am habit has, well, gone by the way-side. HOWEVER, taking a few weeks and writing like I did helped kickstart so many ideas that I'm spending that time now working on those ideas. So you may want to use this approach every-time you get in a slump creatively.
