I had lunch last week with entrepreneur and all around great guy **Bobby Goshal**, founder of [Flud](http://flud.it).

I asked him a question to see if I was crazy.

*I am crazy? Most days, I'll be listening to a TedTalk podcast on my laptop while I'm working, then **sprint** to the bathroom and start reading a business book on my phone (my wife yells me for staying in there so long), then sprint **back** to laptop, listen to a Stanford Leadership Podcast, then **jump** in the car to pick up my son from school and **immediately** put on a Startup School talk from Seth Godin.* (I turn it off when he gets in so DON'T YOU JUDGE ME, haha...)

*Then there are times when I'll walk around Target with my phone up to my ear listening to a Dave Ramsey seminar while Marisa shops (which could take hours). Later on that evening I'll fall asleep with a headphone in my ear listening to a Mixergy interview...(until I finally hear the obvious _put that phone away_ sigh from Marisa)*

I knew I wasn't alone when Bobby jumped up, yelled _**HECK YEA**_ and high-fived me...

This is the whole reason I write this newsletter.

I **KNOW** there's got to be other **crazies** out there that want to make a real impact on the world and **LOVE** learning as much as they possibly can... _whenever_ and _wherever_ they can.

The most exciting thing about the web to me is the sheer amount of amazing **FREE** information out there for the taking.

Podcasts are the perfect learning method, because you can listen **AND** do other things at the same time.

Listen while you're at **work**.

If you can't listen while you **work**, then **driving** is the perfect time.

If you don't **drive**, then listen on the **walk** to work.

If you don't **walk** to work then listen on the **train**, **bus** or **subway**.

If you don't do any of those, **you've got other problems...**

If you get in the habit of listening **_every day_**, it will change your life and your business.

I **guaran-freakin-tee-it** brah.

## Stanford Podcasts

I've linked to some of these before, but it boggles my mind just how much information is in every single one of these talks. It will probably take me years to go through each one a couple times, but it will be worth every second.
