When I was a wee-lad designer, or "knee high to a grasshopper" as my Grandfather would say, I didn't care about words. I used "Lorem Ipsom" like it was my native tongue.

As I got older I realized that words have a HUGE effect on everything I build. I vowed to learn everything I could about copywriting, and I urge you to do the same if you haven't already.

But even if you learn to write amazing headlines and wonderfully crafted body text, you may still be neglecting some of the most important text.

That text is called **Microcopy**.

**What is Microcopy?**

Microcopy is small pieces of text in and around different areas on any given page. Some examples would be text on a button or hint text below an input field. It's small but the effects are HUGE when done right.

**Why use Microcopy?**

If you find yourself getting the same questions about your app over and and over again, consider adding some small text to the problem area that briefly explains how it works. Microcopy allows you to address any feature or function in context, since it's usually in close proximity.

**What are some good examples of Microcopy?**

*   If you are asking someone to fill out a form, let them know which fields can be changed later. It takes the pressure off the users to get it right on the first try [(Example)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bokardo/3619218966/).
*   Under your newsletter signup input, let the user know what frequency you'll be emailing them, and that you promise not to spam them [(Example)](http://cl.ly/QuQe).
*   Don't use the word SUBMIT on a button, unless you're asking for the user to submit to your every demand...awkward... Make it specific to the action the user is taking [(Example)](http://cl.ly/QuxT).
*   Campaign Monitor does something really cool with button text by replacing it with your name [(Example)](http://bit.ly/16mzcv0).
*   You can use microcopy to answer objections just as "how long will this take me?" [(Example)](http://cl.ly/Qu3F)
