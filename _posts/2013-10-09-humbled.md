How many of you have read the following words on Twitter or Facebook.

*"Today I was really truly humbled by [insert really awesome accomplishment with a hint of braggadociousness]."*

Every time I see this I'm confused and bewildered. I mean bewildered in the kinda way that makes me want to punch a whole through my sweet baby Macbook Pro.

I don't know about you, but when something really amazing happens to me, or I'm in some way rewarded for something I've done, my first reaction is far from "humble". In fact it's usually followed by me blasting Drake's "Started from the Bottom" and bobbing my head in the awesomest way possible while driving to Trader Joes in our Jetta. I quickly realize that yes, this is cool, but I also realize that *"pride comes before the fall"*, so usually I snap myself out of it.

I'll tell you the times I'm feeling most humbled. When I work for months on a new product or feature, get all pumped up for the big launch day, and 2 hours after launch, it's either broken and customers are mad, or nobody buys anything and all I hear is the soft wimper of my empty Paypal account.

Now **THAT'S** humbling. You quickly realize that everything is not under your control and sometimes you'll get things wrong, sometimes it won't work out. It's in those moments where you realize that humility is what keeps you on your toes and what keeps you trying to get better.

*p.s. Im pretty freakin humble, like probably WAY more humble than you, like by a lot, just sayin...*
