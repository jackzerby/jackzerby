You may be asking how I would even go about doing that? Would I go for an uppercut or jab, and would I probably end up ducking anyway? Or maybe you want to know why I was so distraught after learning the power of lifecycle emails?

Let me explain...

We started building Flavors.me in 2008, 2 years later we had over 750,000 people signed up. We sold it to Moo last year though...t'was bittersweet.

Well that's fantastic Jack, why are you upset about that?

Because the userbase could have been WAYYY bigger had we implemented these emails.

**Here's what I would've done**

1.  User signs up.
2.  Send a welcome email showing them how to complete the first 3 tasks to getting their site up and running.
3.  3 days later, if the user HAS added a service, send them an email showing them how to customize the design, give them links to other great looking Flavors sites, and include valuable resources and content around the importance of building a personal brand.
4.  6 days later, If they HAVEN'T added a service, send them an email asking them if they had any trouble adding a service and that they can reply directly to our support team with any issues.
5.  9 days later, if they HAVE upgraded to the Pro account, send them an email offering 1 month free if they pay for the year, instead of monthly. (this would have been HUGE)
6.  12 days later, if they HAVEN'T upgraded, send them an email with a coupon for 25% off the Pro Account.

The amount of conversations we could have started and the amount of things we would have learned through that dialogue would have been invaluable.

The sad news is that most startups make these same mistakes.

You'll sign up for a service, check it out for a bit, find they are missing a crucial feature, sign off and never come back again. Imagine if you got an email a couple days later from the founder or support team asking if there were any issues getting started? Not some salesy pitch, but a genuine offer to help. They could potentially win you back as a customer.

**What are lifecycle emails?**

Emails that are sent at timed intervals based on a users behavior and engagement. 

**Why are lifecycle emails important?**

These email's do two important things. First, they start conversations. These conversations allow you to learn from what is working and what is not working. Second, they help your users get more value out of the product or service. By sending them valuable and helpful content, you create a much more pleasant experience.

**What are some tips**

*   Don't be too aggressive, space them out so the user doesn't feel bombarded.
*   After they become a monthly paying customer, send an email a few days later offering them yearly billing for 25% off. (This was HUGE for [WPEngine](#))
*   Include a question or ask for a response, to engage your audience and create a connection. Only do this if you can commit to actually answering these emails, otherwise they'll backfire.
