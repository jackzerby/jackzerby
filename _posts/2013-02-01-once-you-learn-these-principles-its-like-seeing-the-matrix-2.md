If you already built an awesome business/startup and you're too cool for school, don't read anything below this line.

Tell me if this relates to you...

You're in the shower singing Back At One by Brian McKnight (woops maybe just me) and you get a KILLER idea.

Like, for real guys, a KILLER idea...

You sprint to your computer and Google the domain "unbreakableshowcurtainrings.com"

CRAP, somebody bought it!

Oh well you'll just buy unbreakableshowcurtainRINGZ.biz

BOOM YOU'RE IN BUSINESS!

You call up your bff who's a pretty smart Sys-Admin down at AwesomeTech.

"DUDE I've got the best idea EVER. I should probably have you sign an NDA before I tell you this because someone is gonna steal it like in the Facebook movie...Don't steal it bro."

AND GUESS WHAT...HE SAYS IT'S AN AWESOME IDEA!

Then you realize you have to actually BUILD the unbreakable shower curtain rings...

You ask yourself, do people need unbreakable shower curtain rings?

"OF COURSE THEY DO, BECAUSE IT'S MY IDEA AND THEY WILL BUY IT BECAUSE I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT!"

You think to yourself "I've gotta act on this NOW or someone else is gonna build these bad boys".

You head over to Amazon and buy a book on Shower Curtain Ring Building For Dummies for $85, a new laptop for $3000 (if you're gonna do this for real you need the RIGHT equipment), and a sweet new desk for all the hours you're going to put into the biz.

Then you command tab over to Google again and look for shower curtain ring manufacturers.

After scrolling mindlessly through pages of confusing links, you soon think to yourself, eh this is kinda hard.

I'll pick it up again tomorrow night.

Oh well, back to the shower.

I've probably repeated this process about 100 times in my life.

So has my Dad. (It runs in the family I guess)

(My favorite invention of my Dads is called the SlinkyDrink. I'll leave it at that.)

If you're like me, you're probably looking for a better way to go about this.

If you aren't looking for a better way, then let me ask Dr. Phil...

"How's that workin for ya?"

Dane Maxwell had a great way of putting it.

What is the ONLY thing you need to have a business?

Not a business card
Not a logo
Not a "brand"
Not a website
You only need one thing.

What is it?

A paying customer.

I hate you Jack.

If you go out and build a product, design a logo and print up sweet embossed business cards you STILL don't have a business.

All you have is a website, logo and cards.

The goal is to VALIDATE the business in the quickest most efficient way possible BEFORE doing all of the above.

Startup guru Steve Blank describes a start up as "an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model".
So in the beginning, you're in the search phase, not the "build it and they will come" phase.

That only worked for Kevin Costner...

Let me explain a real life example of testing an idea:

At my parents house in PA there's a mirror in the back hallway that some would call a "skinny mirror"

It literally takes off 10 pounds and makes you look freakin fantastic...

I asked my Mom "Don't you think other people would want this mirror too?"

"JACKIE THAT'S IT! THAT'S A MILLION DOLLAR IDEA! GO MAKE THEM. GO MAKE 1000 RIGHT NOW!"

Instead of going down the usual path of crazytown, I stopped myself.

I wanted to test it first.

I bought the domain http://myskinnymirror.com for $5.99 and threw up a SUPER simple html page with a free MailChimp email signup embed.

My Mom kept saying "Wait you can't put a website up yet, you don't have the mirrors!"

I kept telling her that I would ONLY buy the mirrors if I got a ton of signups.

If I didn't then I wouldn't buy any mirrors.

You'll never believe what happened next.

Even after Pinning it, Facebooking it AND Twittering it, I got a grand total of THREE signups, which included my sister Kayla and my wife Marisa.

I was PUMPED!

Why would you be pumped??? Nobody signed up???

I was pumped because I just saved myself a BOATLOAD of time AND money.

OK great Jack, how do I go about testing these ideas?

Check out all the links below, then email your idea and we can figure out how to test it.

Every idea is different so I can't just point to ONE way to do it.

## Steve Blank - Startup Tools and Blogs

Steve Blank assembled a ridiculously **HUGE** list of anything startup related

[http://steveblank.com/tools-and-blogs-for-entrepreneurs](http://steveblank.com/tools-and-blogs-for-entrepreneurs/)

## Steve Blank - The Startup Owners Manual

If you're looking for an **AMAZING** amount of information on every single step in the development of a startup, this book is for you. There's no way you can read it like a normal book because of the sheer amount of information inside. It's best to use it as a reference manual. Highly highly recommended if you're serious about building a business.

## Drew Houston (Founder of Dropbox) - Finding Your Way as an Entrepreneur

An **amazing** story of how Drew tested the idea of Dropbox with a crappy demo video that went viral.

## David Heineimeier Hansson (Founder of Ruby on Rails, 37 Signals) - Unlearn Your MBA

David lays the **SMACK** down on startup culture and makes a great case for bootstrapping your startup (aka don't raise money). Loved it.

## Reid Hoffman (Founder of Linkedin)

## AppSumo - How We Killed A Wantrepreneur

If you're looking for a quick dirty step by step process to test ideas, this is definitely for you. "He was spending money and time on his business idea... instead we made him $75 within 17 hours by doing a simple "validation test" on Craigslist"

## Jay Abraham - School of Copywriting

This video has a ton of useful tips in it.

His idea about going to review sites (book reviews, app reviews, any type of reviews) to find the language that customers use to describe the problem is GENIUS.

You can get tons of actionable information by researching competitors app reviews for what customers love/hate about it.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTbmqyvurs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlTbmqyvurs)

I followed his advice, and when my friend Justin and I wanted to build an app for Crossfitters, I went to the Google Play store and wrote down all the useful reviews left by satisfied and unsatisfied customers from competitors apps. It's a **GOLDMINE** of information.

## Derek Halpern - Creating Information Gaps

"Remember, when you create a gap between what people know, and what people want to know, they feel compelled to fill that gap."

## Dane Maxwell - Marketing Mindset

"Newbie marketers start with product. To the newbie marketer, the business can't exist until the product is created. Let's repeat thatâ€¦ Newbie marketers believe that the first step in starting a business is to create a product."

## Steve Jobs' Unfortunate Contribution to Product Development

"The answer is usually along the lines of, "it's a really great idea and we use the product so much, we know our customers will." But how do you know the idea will succeed, have you tested it with your customers? Ah, but Steve Jobs didn't do market tests when he created the iPhone, he just made it."

## The Gary Halbert Letter - TEST TEST TEST

"Hear this: Most new marketing ideas fail. That's OK. You just keep swinging the bat till you hit a home run and then, once you've got your winner, you simply milk it for all it's worth. But, what's important, really important, is to find out if your idea has any merit as fast as possible! And, the way to do that is by..."
